    "section": "3.1 What are “omics”?",
    "text": "3.1 What are “omics”?\nThe term “omics” refers to a broad field of biology aimed at the comprehensive characterisation and quantification of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism. At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more. Each of these fields leverages high-throughput technologies to generate massive datasets that capture complex interactions within cells, tissues, or organisms.\nThe rise of “omics” has revolutionised biology by enabling researchers to ask holistic questions such as how different genes, proteins, or metabolites interact in health and disease. It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies. In public health, “omics” provides tools to bridge molecular discoveries with population-level outcomes, offering new opportunities to tackle complex health challenges.\n\n3.1.1 Some examples of a “cell-biology” question\n\nHow the brain develops (i.e. the longitudinal sequence of events between birth and maturation), shown in Figure 3.1.\n\nHow microglia in the brain gain or lose certain functions during ageing, shown in Figure 3.2.\n\nWhy certain cells (i.e. cancer cells) divide uncontrollably, see Figure 3.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: What is the sequence of cell types that emerge (and where) during human brain development?

    "text": "3.2 How “omics” comes into the picture\nTo answer cell-biology questions we leverage different omics to learn clues about\n1. the cellular functions of a biological system, and\n2. how those functions change during disease, ageing, etc.\nAll these omics are related:\n\nThe central dogma of biology (DNA → RNA → protein) is illustrated in Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5, linking the three most fundamental omics.\n\nThe epigenome, shown in Figure 3.6, comprises chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins that regulate gene expression yet are not part of the DNA itself. The figure highlights three commonly studied features: DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and histone modifications.\n\nThese layers are summarised in Figure 3.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Central dogma. (Source: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/translation/a/intro-to-gene-expression-central-dogma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Central dogma.

(Wen et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: Biology is constantly revising the details).\nStatistical knowledge is rarely revised—mostly refined. We know properties that generalize to much broader settings (i.e., less statistical assumptions) and much more refined statistical rates for the settings studied two decades ago. (1) There’s little revisions, since once someone proves a statistical theorem, it is very unlikely for it to get disproven in the future. (2) Statistics generally focuses on what happens in an ``average/typical’’ scenario.\nBiology, in comparison, has many revisions and refinements. There’s a couple reasons for this: (1) Biology research is driven by technology. Hence, as we can image/sequence/profile new aspects of a cell, design new model organisms, or collect more data, we might revise a lot of understanding of how cells work. (2) While there are broad biological mechanisms that generally hold true, many diseases occur when the general biological principle no longer holds true. For this reasons, a lot of cell biology research is about these exceptions, which cause us to question how universally true a biological mechanism is. (As a simple example – we’re taught humans have 46 chromosomes. However, many conditions such as Down Syndrome, originate from having an abnormal number of chromosomes.)\n\n\nRemark (All the omics we will study in this course are matrices).\nOne of major missions of this course is to answer the following question: Every omic is represented as a matrix (generally, where the rows are cells, and columns are certain features, depending on the omic). In that case, how come some statistical methods designed for one omic isn’t applicable for another omic?\nWhile there are certain statistical answers to this question, most of the answers are based on biology. Certain methods rely on a specific biological premise, and that premise becomes hard to justify as you switch from one omic to another.\nThis is not too dissimilar from a causal analysis. In a causal analysis, the reason certain features get labeled as a confounder, treatment, outcome, instrumental variable, mediator, etc. relies on the context.\n\n\n\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

    "section": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?",
    "text": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?\n\n2.2.1 Basic biology\nSingle-cell data offer a transformative lens to study the fundamental processes of life at unparalleled resolution. Unlike bulk data, which averages signals across populations of cells, single-cell technologies allow researchers to examine the diversity and complexity of individual cells within a tissue or organism. This level of detail provides insights into key biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation during development, the plasticity of cell states in response to environmental cues, and the organization of complex tissues. For instance, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered new cell types in the brain and immune system, challenging traditional classifications and offering a more nuanced understanding of cellular identities and functions. These insights are essential for constructing more accurate models of how life operates at a cellular level.\nMany of the examples shown in Figs. Figure 2.1–Figure 2.2 are basic biology questions. Two additional examples are shown in Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: How do cancer cells survive successive therapies? (Schaff et al. 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: What deteriorates in a cell as it ages (Silva and Schumacher 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Benchside-to-bedside applications\nSingle-cell data have enormous potential to revolutionize clinical practice by bridging molecular biology and medicine. After learning basic biology, the next stage is to use our newfound understanding to advance treatments. (We typically call this translation research, to denote translating our basic biology knowledge to therapeutic improvements.) This is also called benchside (for the wet-bench, i.e. laboratory setting) to bedside (for the hospital setting).\nBy mapping cellular heterogeneity in diseased and healthy tissues, researchers can identify specific cell populations driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. For example, in cancer, single-cell analyses have uncovered rare tumor subclones that evade treatment, providing critical targets for drug development. Similarly, in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, single-cell profiling of synovial tissues has identified inflammatory cell states that correlate with disease severity and treatment response. Beyond diagnostics, this technology enables precision medicine by tailoring treatments to the molecular profiles of individual patients. As single-cell approaches continue to evolve, they are poised to refine drug-discovery pipelines, improve vaccine design, and ultimately transform how diseases are diagnosed and treated.\nThere are a few ways this typically happens. Figure 2.10 shows one example, where single-cell research helps identify the specific cell types and specific edits needed to improve cellular function. Figure 2.11 shows another example, where understanding the cellular functions, we can improve how conventional methods can be used to measure more accurate biomarkers. Cancer research has been (by far) the biggest beneficiary of single-cell research, and Figure 2.12 illustrates how single-cell improves cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: There are current single-cell therapies that involve extracting blood from a donor, altering the cells outside the body, and then infusing the altered blood back into the donor. (Source: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/crispr-cancer-research-treatment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: After learning the causal mechanisms for specific cell types for Alzheimer’s disease that can be detected from blood draws, we can refine existing biomarkers to monitor Alzheimer’s. (Hansson et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Example of how insights from single-cell studies transform cancer therapies. (Gohil et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 What existed prior to single-cell data?\nWestern blots and flow cytometry.\nBefore the advent of single-cell technologies, biological research relied heavily on methods like western blots and flow cytometry to study cells and molecules. Western blotting (shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14), developed in the late 1970 s, enabled researchers to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample, providing insights into cellular pathways and protein-expression levels. However, this technique required lysing entire tissues or cell populations, averaging the signals from thousands or millions of cells. Flow cytometry (shown in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16), emerging in the 1980s, represented a major step forward by allowing researchers to analyse individual cells’ physical and chemical characteristics in suspension. While flow cytometry offered single-cell resolution, it was limited to analysing predefined markers and could not capture the full complexity of cellular states or gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Illustration of the Western-blot technique. (Source: https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/western-blotting-electrophoresis-techniques)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Example Western-blot data. (Kepchia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Illustration of flow-cytometry technique. (Source: https://www.streck.com/blog/principles-of-flow-cytometry/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Example flow-cytometry data. (Verschoor et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\nMicroarray technology.\nThe 1990s marked the rise of microarray technology (shown in Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18), which allowed scientists to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Microarrays revolutionised transcriptomics by enabling high-throughput studies of gene activity in various conditions, tissues, and diseases. Despite its transformative impact, microarray analysis was fundamentally a bulk method, averaging signals across all cells in a sample. It is also based on light intensity, which can be tricky to extract consistently. These limitations obscured cellular heterogeneity, especially in complex tissues where distinct cell types or states contribute uniquely to biological processes or disease mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Illustration of microarray technique. (Source: https://www.onlinebiologynotes.com/dna-microarray-principle-types-and-steps-involved-in-cdna-microarrays/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Example microarray image prior to quantification. (Source: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat555/node/28/)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: the close history between microarrays and high-dimensional statistics).\nHistorically, the rise of microarray data spurred advances in high-dimensional statistics — e.g. the Lasso (Tibshirani et al. 2005), gene-expression classification for leukaemia (Golub et al. 1999), and empirical-Bayes multiple testing (Efron and Tibshirani 2002).\n\nBulk sequencing technologies.\nIn the 2000s, bulk sequencing technologies for DNA and RNA emerged, further advancing the study of genomes and transcriptomes. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) became a powerful tool for capturing the entire transcriptome with greater accuracy and dynamic range than microarrays. Similarly, DNA sequencing enabled comprehensive studies of genetic variation, from point mutations to structural alterations. However, like microarrays, bulk sequencing aggregated signals across many cells, masking rare cell populations and the heterogeneity critical to understanding dynamic processes such as tumour evolution or immune responses. These bulk techniques laid the groundwork for single-cell methods by driving innovations in high-throughput sequencing and data analysis, which would later be adapted for single-cell resolution.",

    "text": "2.3 When did single-cell data become popular, and how has the technology advanced?\n\n2.3.1 The rise of single-cell data\nSingle-cell data began gaining prominence in the early 2010s, fuelled by advances in microfluidics and next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), pioneered around 2009 – 2011, was among the first methods to achieve widespread adoption. It enabled measurement of gene expression in individual cells, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk analyses masked. Early applications revealed new cell types and states, reshaped our understanding of development, and identified rare populations in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Popularity grew as throughput increased, costs fell, and workflows became standardised.\nFigure 2.19 and Figure 2.20 contrasts bulk and single-cell sequencing. Figure 2.21 shows how single-cell data tease apart different sources of heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: Illustrations of how single-cell sequencing improves resolution for studying cancer resistance.

Single-cell proteomics allows detailed analysis of protein expression and signalling pathways. Single-cell ATAC-seq profiles chromatin accessibility; Hi-C and related methods reveal 3D genome architecture. Spatial transcriptomics connects gene expression with tissue context. CRISPR-based single-cell screens enable high-throughput perturbations, and lineage-tracing barcodes add a temporal dimension, charting cell ancestry in development and disease. Together, these advances transformed single-cell biology into a multi-dimensional, integrative discipline.\nMany of these technologies appear in Figure 2.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Illustration (circa 2020) of technologies that pair various omics at single-cell resolution.

    "text": "2.4 What is the role of a biostatistician in a wet-lab / clinical world?\nCell biology is vast – especially for students trained primarily in statistics or biostatistics. Many disciplines intersect with cell biology. For example:\n\nStatistics / Biostatistics – statistical models for complex biological processes; translation between maths and biology\nComputational biology – scalable computation, leveraging public data\nBioinformatics / Genetics – tools that draw on large‐consortium resources\nEpidemiology – population-level data and policy recommendations\nBioengineering – new laboratory technologies for cheaper/faster measurement or imaging\nBiology – mechanistic studies in model organisms\nBiochemistry / Molecular biology – structure, function, interactions of specific molecules\nWet-bench medicine – disease mechanisms via tissues, models, cell lines\nClinical-facing medicine – patient treatment and real-world sample collection\nPharmacology – integrating evidence to design new drugs and therapies\n\nGiven so many players, what does a biostatistician contribute?\n\n2.4.1 How a biostatistician perceives the world\nGive me a concrete (ideally cleaned) dataset: the larger the better—and I will analyse it from many angles.\nCausality: A mathematically stricter notion than correlation, usually via (1) counterfactual reasoning, or (2) a directed-acyclic-graph picture of how variables relate.\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: statistical causality for cell biology is extremely difficult). Obstacles: (i) tracking the same cell over time is impossible because sequencing lyses it; (ii) longitudinal human tissue samples are rare. Strong modelling assumptions can help but must withstand biological scrutiny. The bottleneck is often data, not maths—ambitious statisticians who learn enough biology still have a fighting chance.\n\n\nRemark (Single-cell methods are largely an “associative” world): Most single-cell analyses discover mechanisms that are statistically correlational; the causal proof comes from experiments and biology.\n\nThe research inquiry starts and ends with a method: (How to integrate modalities? learn a gene-regulatory network? perform valid post-clustering tests?) Start with a statistical model and a parameter of interest \\(\\theta^*\\), then typically:\n\nDevelop a novel estimator of \\(\\theta^*\\), explaining why current methods fail (e.g. lack robustness, accuracy, power, or are heuristic). Focus on statistical logic: A clear, simple mathematical intuition should show the gap and how the new method fills it.\nProve theorems showing the estimate \\(\\hat\\theta\\) converges to \\(\\theta^*\\) under stated assumptions. Focus on consistency & convergence: More data should provably yield more accurate results (often the highlight of a statistics paper).\nSimulations demonstrating that when the true \\(\\theta^*\\) is known, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) beats competing estimators across many settings. Illustration via benchmarking: Empirically recover the correct answer more often than existing methods.\nReal-data demonstration showing results align with known biology or provide biologically sensible new insights. Focus on practicality: The method must work in real scenarios mirroring its target audience.\n\nMindset: deliver a reliable tool that others can trust as-is. Human validations are often impractical; guard-rails and diagnostics are vital.\nWhy biostatisticians need wet-lab biologists / clinicians: We rarely generate data ourselves, so collaborators supply (i) exciting data with novel questions, (ii) biological context for sensible assumptions, and (iii) experimental validation of statistical findings.\n\n\n2.4.2 How a wet-lab biologist / clinician perceives the world\nExperiments, experiments, experiments: Carefully controlled—even if small—to make downstream analysis straightforward.\nCausality comes from a chain of experiments. Suppose we study a gene’s role in disease:\n\nTemporal evidence, such as change in gene expression preceding a change in cell phenotype. A causal mechanism should occur before the phenotype.\nBiological logic providing explanation of the underlying mechanism (binding factors, protein function, evolutionary rationale, etc.). For example, there must be a coherent pathway from gene → protein → phenotype.\nUniversality of how the described association persists across cell lines or organisms. A causal mechanism should be discoverable in other systems (extent depends on how general the logic is). This is offten the highlight of a biology paper.\nValidation, such as knocking out the gene alters the outcome, whereas similar genes do not. For example, perturbing the specific gene (not its close counterparts) changes the outcome.\n\nInquiry starts and ends with a biological hypothesis: Large intellectual effort goes into proposing explanations and designing experiments to rule them in or out.\nMindset: Assemble overwhelming evidence for a mechanism, combining careful experiments and biological logic.\nWhy wet-lab scientists need biostatisticians: Data are now complex and plentiful; exhaustive experiments for every hypothesis are infeasible. Statistical methods can (i) account for data & biological complexity and (ii) prioritise hypotheses worth experimental investment.\n\nSo how does a biostatistician develop computational / statistical methods for cell biology?\n\n\nBiological context – What is the biological system and the “north-star” question? Which premises are accepted, which ones are to be tested, and why is it important to understand this mechanism better?\nTechnology, experiment, data – How are data collected and why did you choose this particular {technology, experiment, data} trio? What technical artefacts arise?\nBoundaries of current tools – Simple analyses first: what “breaks” in existing workflows? Is there preliminary evidence a new computational method would do better?\nStatistical model – What is the insight that a different computational method could interrogate the biology better? (Here the statistics training begins.)\nDevelop a method & show robustness – Robustness can be defined numerically (i.e., noise tolerance) or biologically (i.e., applicable across contexts/environments).

At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more.

It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements.

    "section": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?",
    "text": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?\n\n2.2.1 Basic biology\nSingle-cell data offer a transformative lens to study the fundamental processes of life at unparalleled resolution. Unlike bulk data, which averages signals across populations of cells, single-cell technologies allow researchers to examine the diversity and complexity of individual cells within a tissue or organism. This level of detail provides insights into key biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation during development, the plasticity of cell states in response to environmental cues, and the organization of complex tissues. For instance, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered new cell types in the brain and immune system, challenging traditional classifications and offering a more nuanced understanding of cellular identities and functions. These insights are essential for constructing more accurate models of how life operates at a cellular level.\nMany of the examples shown in Figs. Figure 2.1–Figure 2.2 are basic biology questions. Two additional examples are shown in Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: How do cancer cells survive successive therapies? (Schaff et al. 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: What deteriorates in a cell as it ages (Silva and Schumacher 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Benchside-to-bedside applications\nSingle-cell data have enormous potential to revolutionize clinical practice by bridging molecular biology and medicine. After learning basic biology, the next stage is to use our newfound understanding to advance treatments. (We typically call this translation research, to denote translating our basic biology knowledge to therapeutic improvements.) This is also called benchside (for the wet-bench, i.e. laboratory setting) to bedside (for the hospital setting).\nBy mapping cellular heterogeneity in diseased and healthy tissues, researchers can identify specific cell populations driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. For example, in cancer, single-cell analyses have uncovered rare tumor subclones that evade treatment, providing critical targets for drug development. Similarly, in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, single-cell profiling of synovial tissues has identified inflammatory cell states that correlate with disease severity and treatment response. Beyond diagnostics, this technology enables precision medicine by tailoring treatments to the molecular profiles of individual patients. As single-cell approaches continue to evolve, they are poised to refine drug-discovery pipelines, improve vaccine design, and ultimately transform how diseases are diagnosed and treated.\nThere are a few ways this typically happens. Figure 2.10 shows one example, where single-cell research helps identify the specific cell types and specific edits needed to improve cellular function. Figure 2.11 shows another example, where understanding the cellular functions, we can improve how conventional methods can be used to measure more accurate biomarkers. Cancer research has been (by far) the biggest beneficiary of single-cell research, and Figure 2.12 illustrates how single-cell improves cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: There are current single-cell therapies that involve extracting blood from a donor, altering the cells outside the body, and then infusing the altered blood back into the donor. (Source: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/crispr-cancer-research-treatment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: After learning the causal mechanisms for specific cell types for Alzheimer’s disease that can be detected from blood draws, we can refine existing biomarkers to monitor Alzheimer’s. (Hansson et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Example of how insights from single-cell studies transform cancer therapies. (Gohil et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 What existed prior to single-cell data?\nWestern blots and flow cytometry.\nBefore the advent of single-cell technologies, biological research relied heavily on methods like western blots and flow cytometry to study cells and molecules. Western blotting (shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14), developed in the late 1970 s, enabled researchers to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample, providing insights into cellular pathways and protein-expression levels. However, this technique required lysing entire tissues or cell populations, averaging the signals from thousands or millions of cells. Flow cytometry (shown in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16), emerging in the 1980s, represented a major step forward by allowing researchers to analyse individual cells’ physical and chemical characteristics in suspension. While flow cytometry offered single-cell resolution, it was limited to analysing predefined markers and could not capture the full complexity of cellular states or gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Illustration of the Western-blot technique. (Source: https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/western-blotting-electrophoresis-techniques)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Example Western-blot data. (Kepchia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Illustration of flow-cytometry technique. (Source: https://www.streck.com/blog/principles-of-flow-cytometry/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Example flow-cytometry data. (Verschoor et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\nMicroarray technology.\nThe 1990s marked the rise of microarray technology (shown in Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18), which allowed scientists to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Microarrays revolutionised transcriptomics by enabling high-throughput studies of gene activity in various conditions, tissues, and diseases. Despite its transformative impact, microarray analysis was fundamentally a bulk method, averaging signals across all cells in a sample. It is also based on light intensity, which can be tricky to extract consistently. These limitations obscured cellular heterogeneity, especially in complex tissues where distinct cell types or states contribute uniquely to biological processes or disease mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Illustration of microarray technique. (Source: https://www.onlinebiologynotes.com/dna-microarray-principle-types-and-steps-involved-in-cdna-microarrays/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Example microarray image prior to quantification. (Source: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat555/node/28/)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: the close history between microarrays and high-dimensional statistics).\nHistorically, the rise of microarray data spurred advances in high-dimensional statistics — e.g. the Lasso (Tibshirani et al. 2005), gene-expression classification for leukaemia (Golub et al. 1999), and empirical-Bayes multiple testing (Efron and Tibshirani 2002).\n\nBulk sequencing technologies.\nIn the 2000s, bulk sequencing technologies for DNA and RNA emerged, further advancing the study of genomes and transcriptomes. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) became a powerful tool for capturing the entire transcriptome with greater accuracy and dynamic range than microarrays. Similarly, DNA sequencing enabled comprehensive studies of genetic variation, from point mutations to structural alterations. However, like microarrays, bulk sequencing aggregated signals across many cells, masking rare cell populations and the heterogeneity critical to understanding dynamic processes such as tumour evolution or immune responses. These bulk techniques laid the groundwork for single-cell methods by driving innovations in high-throughput sequencing and data analysis, which would later be adapted for single-cell resolution.",

    "text": "2.3 When did single-cell data become popular, and how has the technology advanced?\n\n2.3.1 The rise of single-cell data\nSingle-cell data began gaining prominence in the early 2010s, fuelled by advances in microfluidics and next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), pioneered around 2009 – 2011, was among the first methods to achieve widespread adoption. It enabled measurement of gene expression in individual cells, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk analyses masked. Early applications revealed new cell types and states, reshaped our understanding of development, and identified rare populations in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Popularity grew as throughput increased, costs fell, and workflows became standardised.\nFigure 2.19 and Figure 2.20 contrasts bulk and single-cell sequencing. Figure 2.21 shows how single-cell data tease apart different sources of heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: Illustrations of how single-cell sequencing improves resolution for studying cancer resistance.

Single-cell proteomics allows detailed analysis of protein expression and signalling pathways. Single-cell ATAC-seq profiles chromatin accessibility; Hi-C and related methods reveal 3D genome architecture. Spatial transcriptomics connects gene expression with tissue context. CRISPR-based single-cell screens enable high-throughput perturbations, and lineage-tracing barcodes add a temporal dimension, charting cell ancestry in development and disease. Together, these advances transformed single-cell biology into a multi-dimensional, integrative discipline.\nMany of these technologies appear in Figure 2.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Illustration (circa 2020) of technologies that pair various omics at single-cell resolution.

    "text": "2.4 What is the role of a biostatistician in a wet-lab / clinical world?\nCell biology is vast – especially for students trained primarily in statistics or biostatistics. Many disciplines intersect with cell biology. For example:\n\nStatistics / Biostatistics – statistical models for complex biological processes; translation between maths and biology\nComputational biology – scalable computation, leveraging public data\nBioinformatics / Genetics – tools that draw on large‐consortium resources\nEpidemiology – population-level data and policy recommendations\nBioengineering – new laboratory technologies for cheaper/faster measurement or imaging\nBiology – mechanistic studies in model organisms\nBiochemistry / Molecular biology – structure, function, interactions of specific molecules\nWet-bench medicine – disease mechanisms via tissues, models, cell lines\nClinical-facing medicine – patient treatment and real-world sample collection\nPharmacology – integrating evidence to design new drugs and therapies\n\nGiven so many players, what does a biostatistician contribute?\n\n2.4.1 How a biostatistician perceives the world\nGive me a concrete (ideally cleaned) dataset: the larger the better—and I will analyse it from many angles.\nCausality: A mathematically stricter notion than correlation, usually via (1) counterfactual reasoning, or (2) a directed-acyclic-graph picture of how variables relate.\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: statistical causality for cell biology is extremely difficult). Obstacles: (i) tracking the same cell over time is impossible because sequencing lyses it; (ii) longitudinal human tissue samples are rare. Strong modelling assumptions can help but must withstand biological scrutiny. The bottleneck is often data, not maths—ambitious statisticians who learn enough biology still have a fighting chance.\n\n\nRemark (Single-cell methods are largely an “associative” world): Most single-cell analyses discover mechanisms that are statistically correlational; the causal proof comes from experiments and biology.\n\nThe research inquiry starts and ends with a method: (How to integrate modalities? learn a gene-regulatory network? perform valid post-clustering tests?) Start with a statistical model and a parameter of interest \\(\\theta^*\\), then typically:\n\nDevelop a novel estimator of \\(\\theta^*\\), explaining why current methods fail (e.g. lack robustness, accuracy, power, or are heuristic). Focus on statistical logic: A clear, simple mathematical intuition should show the gap and how the new method fills it.\nProve theorems showing the estimate \\(\\hat\\theta\\) converges to \\(\\theta^*\\) under stated assumptions. Focus on consistency & convergence: More data should provably yield more accurate results (often the highlight of a statistics paper).\nSimulations demonstrating that when the true \\(\\theta^*\\) is known, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) beats competing estimators across many settings. Illustration via benchmarking: Empirically recover the correct answer more often than existing methods.\nReal-data demonstration showing results align with known biology or provide biologically sensible new insights. Focus on practicality: The method must work in real scenarios mirroring its target audience.\n\nMindset: deliver a reliable tool that others can trust as-is. Human validations are often impractical; guard-rails and diagnostics are vital.\nWhy biostatisticians need wet-lab biologists / clinicians: We rarely generate data ourselves, so collaborators supply (i) exciting data with novel questions, (ii) biological context for sensible assumptions, and (iii) experimental validation of statistical findings.\n\n\n2.4.2 How a wet-lab biologist / clinician perceives the world\nExperiments, experiments, experiments: Carefully controlled—even if small—to make downstream analysis straightforward.\nCausality comes from a chain of experiments. Suppose we study a gene’s role in disease:\n\nTemporal evidence, such as change in gene expression preceding a change in cell phenotype. A causal mechanism should occur before the phenotype.\nBiological logic providing explanation of the underlying mechanism (binding factors, protein function, evolutionary rationale, etc.). For example, there must be a coherent pathway from gene → protein → phenotype.\nUniversality of how the described association persists across cell lines or organisms. A causal mechanism should be discoverable in other systems (extent depends on how general the logic is). This is offten the highlight of a biology paper.\nValidation, such as knocking out the gene alters the outcome, whereas similar genes do not. For example, perturbing the specific gene (not its close counterparts) changes the outcome.\n\nInquiry starts and ends with a biological hypothesis: Large intellectual effort goes into proposing explanations and designing experiments to rule them in or out.\nMindset: Assemble overwhelming evidence for a mechanism, combining careful experiments and biological logic.\nWhy wet-lab scientists need biostatisticians: Data are now complex and plentiful; exhaustive experiments for every hypothesis are infeasible. Statistical methods can (i) account for data & biological complexity and (ii) prioritise hypotheses worth experimental investment.\n\nSo how does a biostatistician develop computational / statistical methods for cell biology?\n\n\nBiological context – What is the biological system and the “north-star” question? Which premises are accepted, which ones are to be tested, and why is it important to understand this mechanism better?\nTechnology, experiment, data – How are data collected and why did you choose this particular {technology, experiment, data} trio? What technical artefacts arise?\nBoundaries of current tools – Simple analyses first: what “breaks” in existing workflows? Is there preliminary evidence a new computational method would do better?\nStatistical model – What is the insight that a different computational method could interrogate the biology better? (Here the statistics training begins.)\nDevelop a method & show robustness – Robustness can be defined numerically (i.e., noise tolerance) or biologically (i.e., applicable across contexts/environments). Often, the biological question you study lacks a ground truth, so validity arguments lean on biological logic.\nUncover new / refined biology – Does the method advance our biological understanding? How confident are we that findings generalise beyond the original {technology, experiment, data} trio? (This is usually the crown-jewel of your computational biology paper – it’s not necessary your specific analyses, but the potential that your tool can be used on other biological studies beyond what you’ve demonstrated your method on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfron, Bradley, and Robert Tibshirani. 2002. “Empirical Bayes Methods and False Discovery Rates for Microarrays.” Genetic Epidemiology 23 (1): 70–86.\n\n\nGohil, Satyen H, J Bryan Iorgulescu, David A Braun, Derin B Keskin, and Kenneth J Livak. 2021. “Applying High-Dimensional Single-Cell Technologies to the Analysis of Cancer Immunotherapy.” Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology 18 (4): 244–56.\n\n\nGolub, Todd R, Donna K Slonim, Pablo Tamayo, Christine Huard, Michelle Gaasenbeek, Jill P Mesirov, Hilary Coller, et al. 1999. “Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring.” Science 286 (5439): 531–37.\n\n\nHansson, Oskar, Kaj Blennow, Henrik Zetterberg, and Jeffrey Dage. 2023. “Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in Clinical Practice and Trials.” Nature Aging 3 (5): 506–19.\n\n\nKepchia, Devin, Ling Huang, Richard Dargusch, Robert A Rissman, Maxim N Shokhirev, Wolfgang Fischer, and David Schubert. 2020. “Diverse Proteins Aggregate in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease Brain.” Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy 12: 1–20.\n\n\nLei, Yalan, Rong Tang, Jin Xu, Wei Wang, Bo Zhang, Jiang Liu, Xianjun Yu, and Si Shi. 2021. “Applications of Single-Cell Sequencing in Cancer Research: Progress and Perspectives.” Journal of Hematology & Oncology 14 (1): 91.\n\n\nSchaff, Dylan L, Aria J Fasse, Phoebe E White, Robert J Vander Velde, and Sydney M Shaffer. 2024. “Clonal Differences Underlie Variable Responses to Sequential and Prolonged Treatment.” Cell Systems 15 (3): 213–26.\n\n\nShalek, Alex K, and Mikael Benson. 2017. “Single-Cell Analyses to Tailor Treatments.” Science Translational Medicine 9 (408): eaan4730.\n\n\nSilva, Paulo FL da, and Björn Schumacher. 2021. “Principles of the Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Aging.” Journal of Investigative Dermatology 141 (4): 951–60.\n\n\nTeichmann, Sarah, and Mirjana Efremova. 2020. “Method of the Year 2019: Single-Cell Multimodal Omics.” Nature Methods 17 (1): 2020.\n\n\nTibshirani, Robert, Michael Saunders, Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, and Keith Knight. 2005. “Sparsity and Smoothness via the Fused Lasso.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology 67 (1): 91–108.\n\n\nVerschoor, Chris P, Alina Lelic, Jonathan L Bramson, and Dawn ME Bowdish. 2015. “An Introduction to Automated Flow Cytometry Gating Tools and Their Implementation.” Frontiers in Immunology 6: 380.\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

    "text": "3.1 The sparse count matrix and the negative binomial\nAt the heart of single-cell sequencing data lies the sparse count matrix, where rows represent genes, columns represent cells, and entries capture the number of sequencing reads (or molecules) detected for each gene in each cell. This matrix is typically sparse because most genes are not expressed in any given cell, leading to a prevalence of zeros. The data’s sparsity reflects both the biological reality of selective gene expression and technical limitations such as sequencing depth. To model the variability in these counts, the negative binomial distribution is often employed. This distribution accommodates overdispersion, where the observed variability in gene expression counts exceeds what would be expected under simpler models like the Poisson distribution. By accounting for both biological heterogeneity and technical noise, the negative binomial provides a robust framework for analyzing sparse single-cell data.\nLet \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) denote the single-cell data matrix with \\(n\\) cells (rows) and \\(p\\) features (columns). In a single-cell RNA-seq data matrix, the \\(p\\) features represent the \\(p\\) genes.\nHere are some basic statistics about these matrices (based mainly from my experience):\nBased on these observations, the negative binomial distribution is very commonly used.\nThe negative binomial (NB) distribution is a widely used model in single-cell RNA-seq analysis due to its ability to handle overdispersion, which is common in gene expression data. Overdispersion occurs when the variance of the data exceeds the mean, a phenomenon that cannot be captured by the Poisson distribution. The NB distribution introduces an additional parameter to model this extra variability, making it more flexible for single-cell data.\nLet us focus on the count for cell \\(i\\) and gene \\(j\\), i.e., the value \\(X_{ij}\\). The probability mass function (pmf) of the NB distribution for a random variable ( X_{ij} ) is given by:\n\\[\nP(X_{ij} = k) = \\binom{k + r_j - 1}{k} p_{ij}^r (1 - p_{ij})^k, \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere ( r_j &gt; 0 ) is the dispersion (or “overdispersion”) parameter and ( p_{ij} (0, 1) ) is the probability of success. This is the “standard” parameterization, mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution. This specific parameterization is actually not very commonly used.\nAlternatively, the NB distribution is most commonly parameterized in terms of the mean \\(\\mu_{ij}\\) and the dispersion parameter \\(r_j\\), which is often preferred in single-cell analysis:\n\\[\n\\text{Mean: } \\mu_{ij}, \\quad \\text{Variance: } \\mu_{ij} + \\frac{\\mu_{ij}^2}{r_j} = \\mu_{ij}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu_{ij}}{r_j}\\right).\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\n(Compare these relations to the Poisson distribution, where both the mean and variance would be \\(\\mu_{ij}\\).)\nTo relate equation Equation 3.1} to Equation 3.2, observe that we can derive,\n\\[\n\\mu_{ij} = \\frac{r_j (1 - p_{ij})}{p_{ij}}.\n\\]\nWe typically use a different overdispersion parameter \\(r_j\\) for each gene \\(j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\). Here, ( r_j ) controls the degree of overdispersion. When ( r_j ), the variance approaches the mean, and the NB distribution converges to the Poisson distribution. For single-cell RNA-seq data, the introduction of ( r_j ) allows the model to capture both the biological variability between cells and technical noise, making it robust to the sparse and overdispersed nature of gene expression data.",

    "text": "For \\(n\\), we usually have 10,000 to 500,000 cells. These cells originate from a specific set of samples/donors/organisms1. See ?fig-lupus and ?fig-zebrafish for larger examples of single-cell datasets.\n\nFor \\(p\\), we usually have about 30,000 genes (but as you’ll see, we usually limit the analysis to 2000 to 5000 genes chosen from this full set).2\n\nIn a typical scRNA-seq matrix, more than 70% of the elements are exactly 0. (And among the remaining 30%, typically half are exactly 1. The maximum count can be in the hundreds, i.e., the distribution is extremely right-skewed.) This is illustrated in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2. We’ll see later in ?sec-scrnaseq_tech where these ``counts’’ come from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Illustration of data from https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html showing a snippet of the count matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of data from https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html showing the percentage of cells with non-zero counts for each gene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would genes even have different overdispersions?\nWe’re assuming in most statistical models that: 1) genes are modeled as a negative binomial random variable, and 2) genes have different overdispersion parameters \\(r_j\\). Why is this reasonable? Is there a biomolecular reason for this?\nWe draw upon (sarkar2021separating?), explaining how the NB distribution is justified (both theoretically and empirically) for scRNA-seq data.\nAfter reading this paper, you’ll see that the overdispersion originates from the “biological noise” (i.e., the Gamma distribution). This differs from gene to gene because gene expression is subject to many aspects: transcriptomic bursting, the proximity between the gene and the promoter, the mRNA stability and degradation, copy number variation, the cell cycle stage, etc.\n\n\n3.1.0.1 How do you estimate the overdispersion parameter in practice?\nThe easiest way is to use MASS::glm.nb in R.\nHowever, this is very noisy for single-cell data (see Remark 3.1).\nSince we are estimate one dispersion parameter per gene, many methods use an Empirical Bayes framework to “smooth” the overdispersion parameters (love2014moderated?).\nMore sophisticated methods (such as SCTransform (hafemeister2019normalization?)) use the Bioconductor R package called glmGamPoi.\nDeep-learning methods simply incorporate estimating the dispersion parameter into the architecture and objective function, see scVI (lopez2018deep?).\nAlso, note that which we are assuming here that the overdispersion parameter \\(r_j\\) is shared across all the cells for gene \\(j\\), there are methods that also use different overdispersion parameters for different cell populations. See (chen2018umi?) or the dispersion parameter in scVI (see https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/api/reference/scvi.model.SCVI.html#scvi.model.SCVI). In general, using different overdispersion parameters for the same gene across different cell populations is not common, so my suggestion is to: 1) have a diagnostic in mind on how would you know if need to use different overdispersion parameters for the same gene, and then 2) try analyzing the genes where each gene only has one overdispersion parameter and see if you have enough concrete evidence that such a model was too simplistic.\n\nPersonal opinion: My preferred parameterization\nThe formulation Equation 3.2 by far is the most common way people write the NB distribution.\nWe typically call \\(r_j\\) the “overdispersion” parameter, since the inclusion of \\(r_j\\) in our modeling is typically to denote that there is more variance than a Poisson.\nI personally don’t like it because I find it confusing that a larger \\(r_j\\) denotes a distribution with smaller variance.\nHence, I usually write the variance as \\(\\mu_{ij}(1+\\alpha_j \\mu_{ij})\\) (where \\(\\alpha_j = 1/r_j\\)). This way, \\(\\alpha_j = 0\\) is a Poisson distribution. However, even though this makes more sense to me, it’s not commonly used. (It’s because this parameterization makes it confusing to work with the exponential-family distributions mathematically.)\nThe main takeaway is to always pay close attention to each paper’s NB parameterization. You’re looking for the mean-variance relation written somewhere in the paper to ensure you understand the author’s notation.\n\n\nRemark 3.1. What makes the negative binomial tricky Let me use an analogy that is based on the more familiar coin toss. Suppose 30 people each are given a weighted coin where the probability of heads is \\(10^{-9}\\) (basically, it’s impossible to get a heads).\nEveryone coerce and agree to a secret number \\(N\\), and everyone independently flips their own coin \\(N\\) times and records the number of heads.\nI (the moderator) do not know \\(N\\), but I get to see how many heads each person got during this experiment.\nMy goal is to estimate \\(N\\). What makes this problem very difficult?\nIf \\(N\\) were 10, or 100, or maybe even 10,000, almost everyone would get 0 heads. That is, we cannot reliably estimate \\(N\\) since the log-likelihood function is very flat. The issue is because count data has a finite resolution — 0 is always the smallest possible value, and 1 is always the second smallest value. Hence, unlike continuous values (which have “infinite resolution” in some sense), non-negative integers “lose” information the smaller the range is.",
