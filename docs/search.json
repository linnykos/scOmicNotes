    "section": "3.1 What are “omics”?",
    "text": "3.1 What are “omics”?\nThe term “omics” refers to a broad field of biology aimed at the comprehensive characterisation and quantification of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism. At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more. Each of these fields leverages high-throughput technologies to generate massive datasets that capture complex interactions within cells, tissues, or organisms.\nThe rise of “omics” has revolutionised biology by enabling researchers to ask holistic questions such as how different genes, proteins, or metabolites interact in health and disease. It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies. In public health, “omics” provides tools to bridge molecular discoveries with population-level outcomes, offering new opportunities to tackle complex health challenges.\n\n3.1.1 Some examples of a “cell-biology” question\n\nHow the brain develops (i.e. the longitudinal sequence of events between birth and maturation), shown in Figure 3.1.\n\nHow microglia in the brain gain or lose certain functions during ageing, shown in Figure 3.2.\n\nWhy certain cells (i.e. cancer cells) divide uncontrollably, see Figure 3.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: What is the sequence of cell types that emerge (and where) during human brain development? (Zhou, Song, and Ming 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Microglia (immune cells of the brain) radically change shape during ageing.\nWhat are the functional consequences of this? (Von Bernhardi, Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Eugenı́n 2015)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Cancer is typically characterised by uncontrollable cell division. What drives this process, how can we detect it early, and how can we stop it? (Source: https://sites.duke.edu/seektobacco/2-the-role-of-tobacco-in-the-development-of-cancer/the-content/)",

(2) Statistics generally focuses on what happens in an ``average/typical’’ scenario.\nBiology, in comparison, has many revisions and refinements. There’s a couple reasons for this: (1) Biology research is driven by technology. Hence, as we can image/sequence/profile new aspects of a cell, design new model organisms, or collect more data, we might revise a lot of understanding of how cells work. (2) While there are broad biological mechanisms that generally hold true, many diseases occur when the general biological principle no longer holds true. For this reasons, a lot of cell biology research is about these exceptions, which cause us to question how universally true a biological mechanism is.

Certain methods rely on a specific biological premise, and that premise becomes hard to justify as you switch from one omic to another.\nThis is not too dissimilar from a causal analysis.

    "section": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?",
    "text": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?\n\n2.2.1 Basic biology\nSingle-cell data offer a transformative lens to study the fundamental processes of life at unparalleled resolution. Unlike bulk data, which averages signals across populations of cells, single-cell technologies allow researchers to examine the diversity and complexity of individual cells within a tissue or organism. This level of detail provides insights into key biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation during development, the plasticity of cell states in response to environmental cues, and the organization of complex tissues. For instance, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered new cell types in the brain and immune system, challenging traditional classifications and offering a more nuanced understanding of cellular identities and functions. These insights are essential for constructing more accurate models of how life operates at a cellular level.\nMany of the examples shown in Figs. Figure 2.1–Figure 2.2 are basic biology questions. Two additional examples are shown in Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: How do cancer cells survive successive therapies? (Schaff et al. 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: What deteriorates in a cell as it ages (Silva and Schumacher 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Benchside-to-bedside applications\nSingle-cell data have enormous potential to revolutionize clinical practice by bridging molecular biology and medicine. After learning basic biology, the next stage is to use our newfound understanding to advance treatments. (We typically call this translation research, to denote translating our basic biology knowledge to therapeutic improvements.) This is also called benchside (for the wet-bench, i.e. laboratory setting) to bedside (for the hospital setting).\nBy mapping cellular heterogeneity in diseased and healthy tissues, researchers can identify specific cell populations driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. For example, in cancer, single-cell analyses have uncovered rare tumor subclones that evade treatment, providing critical targets for drug development. Similarly, in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, single-cell profiling of synovial tissues has identified inflammatory cell states that correlate with disease severity and treatment response. Beyond diagnostics, this technology enables precision medicine by tailoring treatments to the molecular profiles of individual patients. As single-cell approaches continue to evolve, they are poised to refine drug-discovery pipelines, improve vaccine design, and ultimately transform how diseases are diagnosed and treated.\nThere are a few ways this typically happens. Figure 2.10 shows one example, where single-cell research helps identify the specific cell types and specific edits needed to improve cellular function. Figure 2.11 shows another example, where understanding the cellular functions, we can improve how conventional methods can be used to measure more accurate biomarkers. Cancer research has been (by far) the biggest beneficiary of single-cell research, and Figure 2.12 illustrates how single-cell improves cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: There are current single-cell therapies that involve extracting blood from a donor, altering the cells outside the body, and then infusing the altered blood back into the donor. (Source: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/crispr-cancer-research-treatment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: After learning the causal mechanisms for specific cell types for Alzheimer’s disease that can be detected from blood draws, we can refine existing biomarkers to monitor Alzheimer’s. (Hansson et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Example of how insights from single-cell studies transform cancer therapies. (Gohil et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 What existed prior to single-cell data?\nWestern blots and flow cytometry.\nBefore the advent of single-cell technologies, biological research relied heavily on methods like western blots and flow cytometry to study cells and molecules. Western blotting (shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14), developed in the late 1970 s, enabled researchers to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample, providing insights into cellular pathways and protein-expression levels. However, this technique required lysing entire tissues or cell populations, averaging the signals from thousands or millions of cells. Flow cytometry (shown in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16), emerging in the 1980s, represented a major step forward by allowing researchers to analyse individual cells’ physical and chemical characteristics in suspension. While flow cytometry offered single-cell resolution, it was limited to analysing predefined markers and could not capture the full complexity of cellular states or gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Illustration of the Western-blot technique. (Source: https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/western-blotting-electrophoresis-techniques)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Example Western-blot data. (Kepchia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Illustration of flow-cytometry technique. (Source: https://www.streck.com/blog/principles-of-flow-cytometry/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Example flow-cytometry data. (Verschoor et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\nMicroarray technology.\nThe 1990s marked the rise of microarray technology (shown in Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18), which allowed scientists to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Microarrays revolutionised transcriptomics by enabling high-throughput studies of gene activity in various conditions, tissues, and diseases. Despite its transformative impact, microarray analysis was fundamentally a bulk method, averaging signals across all cells in a sample. It is also based on light intensity, which can be tricky to extract consistently. These limitations obscured cellular heterogeneity, especially in complex tissues where distinct cell types or states contribute uniquely to biological processes or disease mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Illustration of microarray technique. (Source: https://www.onlinebiologynotes.com/dna-microarray-principle-types-and-steps-involved-in-cdna-microarrays/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Example microarray image prior to quantification. (Source: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat555/node/28/)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: the close history between microarrays and high-dimensional statistics).\nHistorically, the rise of microarray data spurred advances in high-dimensional statistics — e.g. the Lasso (Tibshirani et al. 2005), gene-expression classification for leukaemia (Golub et al. 1999), and empirical-Bayes multiple testing (Efron and Tibshirani 2002).\n\nBulk sequencing technologies.\nIn the 2000s, bulk sequencing technologies for DNA and RNA emerged, further advancing the study of genomes and transcriptomes. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) became a powerful tool for capturing the entire transcriptome with greater accuracy and dynamic range than microarrays. Similarly, DNA sequencing enabled comprehensive studies of genetic variation, from point mutations to structural alterations. However, like microarrays, bulk sequencing aggregated signals across many cells, masking rare cell populations and the heterogeneity critical to understanding dynamic processes such as tumour evolution or immune responses. These bulk techniques laid the groundwork for single-cell methods by driving innovations in high-throughput sequencing and data analysis, which would later be adapted for single-cell resolution.",

    "text": "2.3 When did single-cell data become popular, and how has the technology advanced?\n\n2.3.1 The rise of single-cell data\nSingle-cell data began gaining prominence in the early 2010s, fuelled by advances in microfluidics and next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), pioneered around 2009 – 2011, was among the first methods to achieve widespread adoption. It enabled measurement of gene expression in individual cells, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk analyses masked. Early applications revealed new cell types and states, reshaped our understanding of development, and identified rare populations in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Popularity grew as throughput increased, costs fell, and workflows became standardised.\nFigure 2.19 and Figure 2.20 contrasts bulk and single-cell sequencing. Figure 2.21 shows how single-cell data tease apart different sources of heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: Illustrations of how single-cell sequencing improves resolution for studying cancer resistance.

Single-cell proteomics allows detailed analysis of protein expression and signalling pathways. Single-cell ATAC-seq profiles chromatin accessibility; Hi-C and related methods reveal 3D genome architecture. Spatial transcriptomics connects gene expression with tissue context. CRISPR-based single-cell screens enable high-throughput perturbations, and lineage-tracing barcodes add a temporal dimension, charting cell ancestry in development and disease. Together, these advances transformed single-cell biology into a multi-dimensional, integrative discipline.\nMany of these technologies appear in Figure 2.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Illustration (circa 2020) of technologies that pair various omics at single-cell resolution.

    "text": "2.4 What is the role of a biostatistician in a wet-lab / clinical world?\nCell biology is vast – especially for students trained primarily in statistics or biostatistics. Many disciplines intersect with cell biology. For example:\n\nStatistics / Biostatistics – statistical models for complex biological processes; translation between maths and biology\nComputational biology – scalable computation, leveraging public data\nBioinformatics / Genetics – tools that draw on large‐consortium resources\nEpidemiology – population-level data and policy recommendations\nBioengineering – new laboratory technologies for cheaper/faster measurement or imaging\nBiology – mechanistic studies in model organisms\nBiochemistry / Molecular biology – structure, function, interactions of specific molecules\nWet-bench medicine – disease mechanisms via tissues, models, cell lines\nClinical-facing medicine – patient treatment and real-world sample collection\nPharmacology – integrating evidence to design new drugs and therapies\n\nGiven so many players, what does a biostatistician contribute?\n\n2.4.1 How a biostatistician perceives the world\nGive me a concrete (ideally cleaned) dataset: the larger the better—and I will analyse it from many angles.\nCausality: A mathematically stricter notion than correlation, usually via (1) counterfactual reasoning, or (2) a directed-acyclic-graph picture of how variables relate.\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: statistical causality for cell biology is extremely difficult). Obstacles: (i) tracking the same cell over time is impossible because sequencing lyses it; (ii) longitudinal human tissue samples are rare. Strong modelling assumptions can help but must withstand biological scrutiny. The bottleneck is often data, not maths—ambitious statisticians who learn enough biology still have a fighting chance.\n\n\nRemark (Single-cell methods are largely an “associative” world): Most single-cell analyses discover mechanisms that are statistically correlational; the causal proof comes from experiments and biology.\n\nThe research inquiry starts and ends with a method: (How to integrate modalities? learn a gene-regulatory network? perform valid post-clustering tests?) Start with a statistical model and a parameter of interest \\(\\theta^*\\), then typically:\n\nDevelop a novel estimator of \\(\\theta^*\\), explaining why current methods fail (e.g. lack robustness, accuracy, power, or are heuristic). Focus on statistical logic: A clear, simple mathematical intuition should show the gap and how the new method fills it.\nProve theorems showing the estimate \\(\\hat\\theta\\) converges to \\(\\theta^*\\) under stated assumptions. Focus on consistency & convergence: More data should provably yield more accurate results (often the highlight of a statistics paper).\nSimulations demonstrating that when the true \\(\\theta^*\\) is known, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) beats competing estimators across many settings. Illustration via benchmarking: Empirically recover the correct answer more often than existing methods.\nReal-data demonstration showing results align with known biology or provide biologically sensible new insights. Focus on practicality: The method must work in real scenarios mirroring its target audience.\n\nMindset: deliver a reliable tool that others can trust as-is. Human validations are often impractical; guard-rails and diagnostics are vital.\nWhy biostatisticians need wet-lab biologists / clinicians: We rarely generate data ourselves, so collaborators supply (i) exciting data with novel questions, (ii) biological context for sensible assumptions, and (iii) experimental validation of statistical findings.\n\n\n2.4.2 How a wet-lab biologist / clinician perceives the world\nExperiments, experiments, experiments: Carefully controlled—even if small—to make downstream analysis straightforward.\nCausality comes from a chain of experiments. Suppose we study a gene’s role in disease:\n\nTemporal evidence, such as change in gene expression preceding a change in cell phenotype. A causal mechanism should occur before the phenotype.\nBiological logic providing explanation of the underlying mechanism (binding factors, protein function, evolutionary rationale, etc.). For example, there must be a coherent pathway from gene → protein → phenotype.\nUniversality of how the described association persists across cell lines or organisms. A causal mechanism should be discoverable in other systems (extent depends on how general the logic is). This is offten the highlight of a biology paper.\nValidation, such as knocking out the gene alters the outcome, whereas similar genes do not. For example, perturbing the specific gene (not its close counterparts) changes the outcome.\n\nInquiry starts and ends with a biological hypothesis: Large intellectual effort goes into proposing explanations and designing experiments to rule them in or out.\nMindset: Assemble overwhelming evidence for a mechanism, combining careful experiments and biological logic.\nWhy wet-lab scientists need biostatisticians: Data are now complex and plentiful; exhaustive experiments for every hypothesis are infeasible. Statistical methods can (i) account for data & biological complexity and (ii) prioritise hypotheses worth experimental investment.\n\nSo how does a biostatistician develop computational / statistical methods for cell biology?\n\n\nBiological context – What is the biological system and the “north-star” question? Which premises are accepted, which ones are to be tested, and why is it important to understand this mechanism better?\nTechnology, experiment, data – How are data collected and why did you choose this particular {technology, experiment, data} trio? What technical artefacts arise?\nBoundaries of current tools – Simple analyses first: what “breaks” in existing workflows? Is there preliminary evidence a new computational method would do better?\nStatistical model – What is the insight that a different computational method could interrogate the biology better? (Here the statistics training begins.)\nDevelop a method & show robustness – Robustness can be defined numerically (i.e., noise tolerance) or biologically (i.e., applicable across contexts/environments). Often, the biological question you study lacks a ground truth, so validity arguments lean on biological logic.\nUncover new / refined biology – Does the method advance our biological understanding? How confident are we that findings generalise beyond the original {technology, experiment, data} trio? (This is usually the crown-jewel of your computational biology paper – it’s not necessary your specific analyses, but the potential that your tool can be used on other biological studies beyond what you’ve demonstrated your method on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfron, Bradley, and Robert Tibshirani. 2002. “Empirical Bayes Methods and False Discovery Rates for Microarrays.” Genetic Epidemiology 23 (1): 70–86.\n\n\nGohil, Satyen H, J Bryan Iorgulescu, David A Braun, Derin B Keskin, and Kenneth J Livak. 2021. “Applying High-Dimensional Single-Cell Technologies to the Analysis of Cancer Immunotherapy.” Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology 18 (4): 244–56.\n\n\nGolub, Todd R, Donna K Slonim, Pablo Tamayo, Christine Huard, Michelle Gaasenbeek, Jill P Mesirov, Hilary Coller, et al. 1999. “Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring.” Science 286 (5439): 531–37.\n\n\nHansson, Oskar, Kaj Blennow, Henrik Zetterberg, and Jeffrey Dage. 2023. “Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in Clinical Practice and Trials.” Nature Aging 3 (5): 506–19.\n\n\nKepchia, Devin, Ling Huang, Richard Dargusch, Robert A Rissman, Maxim N Shokhirev, Wolfgang Fischer, and David Schubert. 2020. “Diverse Proteins Aggregate in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease Brain.” Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy 12: 1–20.\n\n\nLei, Yalan, Rong Tang, Jin Xu, Wei Wang, Bo Zhang, Jiang Liu, Xianjun Yu, and Si Shi. 2021. “Applications of Single-Cell Sequencing in Cancer Research: Progress and Perspectives.” Journal of Hematology & Oncology 14 (1): 91.\n\n\nSchaff, Dylan L, Aria J Fasse, Phoebe E White, Robert J Vander Velde, and Sydney M Shaffer. 2024. “Clonal Differences Underlie Variable Responses to Sequential and Prolonged Treatment.” Cell Systems 15 (3): 213–26.\n\n\nShalek, Alex K, and Mikael Benson. 2017. “Single-Cell Analyses to Tailor Treatments.” Science Translational Medicine 9 (408): eaan4730.\n\n\nSilva, Paulo FL da, and Björn Schumacher. 2021. “Principles of the Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Aging.” Journal of Investigative Dermatology 141 (4): 951–60.\n\n\nTeichmann, Sarah, and Mirjana Efremova. 2020. “Method of the Year 2019: Single-Cell Multimodal Omics.” Nature Methods 17 (1): 2020.\n\n\nTibshirani, Robert, Michael Saunders, Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, and Keith Knight. 2005. “Sparsity and Smoothness via the Fused Lasso.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology 67 (1): 91–108.\n\n\nVerschoor, Chris P, Alina Lelic, Jonathan L Bramson, and Dawn ME Bowdish. 2015. “An Introduction to Automated Flow Cytometry Gating Tools and Their Implementation.” Frontiers in Immunology 6: 380.\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

    "text": "2.1.1 What are “omics”?\nThe term “omics” refers to a broad field of biology aimed at the comprehensive characterisation and quantification of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism. At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more. Each of these fields leverages high-throughput technologies to generate massive datasets that capture complex interactions within cells, tissues, or organisms.\nThe rise of “omics” has revolutionised biology by enabling researchers to ask holistic questions such as how different genes, proteins, or metabolites interact in health and disease. It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies. In public health, “omics” provides tools to bridge molecular discoveries with population-level outcomes, offering new opportunities to tackle complex health challenges.\n\n\n2.1.2 Some examples of a “cell-biology” question\n\nHow the brain develops (i.e. the longitudinal sequence of events between birth and maturation), shown in Figure 2.1.\n\nHow microglia in the brain gain or lose certain functions during ageing, shown in Figure 2.2.\n\nWhy certain cells (i.e. cancer cells) divide uncontrollably, see Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: What is the sequence of cell types that emerge (and where) during human brain development?

What drives this process, how can we detect it early, and how can we stop it? (Source: https://sites.duke.edu/seektobacco/2-the-role-of-tobacco-in-the-development-of-cancer/the-content/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 How “omics” comes into the picture\nTo answer cell-biology questions we leverage different omics to learn clues about\n1. the cellular functions of a biological system, and\n2. how those functions change during disease, ageing, etc.\nAll these omics are related:\n\nThe central dogma of biology (DNA → RNA → protein) is illustrated in Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.5, linking the three most fundamental omics.\n\nThe epigenome, shown in Figure 2.6, comprises chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins that regulate gene expression yet are not part of the DNA itself. The figure highlights three commonly studied features: DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and histone modifications.\n\nThese layers are summarised in Figure 2.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Central dogma. (Source: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/translation/a/intro-to-gene-expression-central-dogma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Central dogma.

(Wen et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: Biology is constantly revising the details).\nStatistical knowledge is rarely revised – its instead mostly refined. We know properties that generalize to much broader settings (i.e., less statistical assumptions) and much more refined statistical rates for the settings studied two decades ago. (1) There’s little revisions, since once someone proves a statistical theorem, it is very unlikely for it to get disproven in the future. (2) Statistics generally focuses on what happens in an “average/typical” scenario.\nBiology, in comparison, has many revisions and refinements. There’s a couple reasons for this: (1) Biology research is driven by technology. Hence, as we can image/sequence/profile new aspects of a cell, design new model organisms, or collect more data, we might revise a lot of understanding of how cells work. (2) While there are broad biological mechanisms that generally hold true, many diseases occur when the general biological principle no longer holds true. For this reasons, a lot of cell biology research is about these exceptions, which cause us to question how universally true a biological mechanism is. (As a simple example – we’re taught humans have 46 chromosomes. However, many conditions such as Down Syndrome, originate from having an abnormal number of chromosomes.)\n\n\nRemark (All the omics we will study in this course are matrices).\nOne of major missions of this course is to answer the following question: Every omic is represented as a matrix (generally, where the rows are cells, and columns are certain features, depending on the omic). In that case, how come some statistical methods designed for one omic isn’t applicable for another omic?\nWhile there are certain statistical answers to this question, most of the answers are based on biology. Certain methods rely on a specific biological premise, and that premise becomes hard to justify as you switch from one omic to another.\nThis is not too dissimilar from a causal analysis. In a causal analysis, the reason certain features get labeled as a confounder, treatment, outcome, instrumental variable, mediator, etc. relies on the context.",

    "text": "2.1.1 What are “omics”?\nThe term “omics” refers to a broad field of biology aimed at the comprehensive characterisation and quantification of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism. At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more. Each of these fields leverages high-throughput technologies to generate massive datasets that capture complex interactions within cells, tissues, or organisms.\nThe rise of “omics” has revolutionised biology by enabling researchers to ask holistic questions such as how different genes, proteins, or metabolites interact in health and disease. It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies. In public health, “omics” provides tools to bridge molecular discoveries with population-level outcomes, offering new opportunities to tackle complex health challenges.\n\n\n2.1.2 Some examples of a “cell-biology” question\n\nHow the brain develops (i.e. the longitudinal sequence of events between birth and maturation), shown in Figure 2.1.\n\nHow microglia in the brain gain or lose certain functions during ageing, shown in Figure 2.2.\n\nWhy certain cells (i.e. cancer cells) divide uncontrollably, see Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: What is the sequence of cell types that emerge (and where) during human brain development? (Zhou, Song, and Ming 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Microglia (immune cells of the brain) radically change shape during ageing.\nWhat are the functional consequences of this?

What drives this process, how can we detect it early, and how can we stop it? (Source: https://sites.duke.edu/seektobacco/2-the-role-of-tobacco-in-the-development-of-cancer/the-content/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 How “omics” comes into the picture\nTo answer cell-biology questions we leverage different omics to learn clues about\n1. the cellular functions of a biological system, and\n2. how those functions change during disease, ageing, etc.\nAll these omics are related:\n\nThe central dogma of biology (DNA → RNA → protein) is illustrated in Figure 2.4 and Figure 2.5, linking the three most fundamental omics.\n\nThe epigenome, shown in Figure 2.6, comprises chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins that regulate gene expression yet are not part of the DNA itself. The figure highlights three commonly studied features: DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and histone modifications.\n\nThese layers are summarised in Figure 2.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Central dogma. (Source: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/translation/a/intro-to-gene-expression-central-dogma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Central dogma. (Source: https://researchfeatures.com/adding-structure-biologys-central-dogma-cancer-treatments-thyroid-cancer/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Epigenetics. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: A non-exhaustive list of omics. (Wen et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: Biology is constantly revising the details).\nStatistical knowledge is rarely revised – its instead mostly refined. We know properties that generalize to much broader settings (i.e., less statistical assumptions) and much more refined statistical rates for the settings studied two decades ago. (1) There’s little revisions, since once someone proves a statistical theorem, it is very unlikely for it to get disproven in the future. (2) Statistics generally focuses on what happens in an “average/typical” scenario.\nBiology, in comparison, has many revisions and refinements. There’s a couple reasons for this: (1) Biology research is driven by technology. Hence, as we can image/sequence/profile new aspects of a cell, design new model organisms, or collect more data, we might revise a lot of understanding of how cells work. (2) While there are broad biological mechanisms that generally hold true, many diseases occur when the general biological principle no longer holds true. For this reasons, a lot of cell biology research is about these exceptions, which cause us to question how universally true a biological mechanism is. (As a simple example – we’re taught humans have 46 chromosomes. However, many conditions such as Down Syndrome, originate from having an abnormal number of chromosomes.)\n\n\nRemark (All the omics we will study in this course are matrices).\nOne of major missions of this course is to answer the following question: Every omic is represented as a matrix (generally, where the rows are cells, and columns are certain features, depending on the omic). In that case, how come some statistical methods designed for one omic isn’t applicable for another omic?\nWhile there are certain statistical answers to this question, most of the answers are based on biology. Certain methods rely on a specific biological premise, and that premise becomes hard to justify as you switch from one omic to another.\nThis is not too dissimilar from a causal analysis. In a causal analysis, the reason certain features get labeled as a confounder, treatment, outcome, instrumental variable, mediator, etc. relies on the context.",

    "text": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?\n\n2.2.1 Basic biology\nSingle-cell data offer a transformative lens to study the fundamental processes of life at unparalleled resolution. Unlike bulk data, which averages signals across populations of cells, single-cell technologies allow researchers to examine the diversity and complexity of individual cells within a tissue or organism. This level of detail provides insights into key biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation during development, the plasticity of cell states in response to environmental cues, and the organization of complex tissues. For instance, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered new cell types in the brain and immune system, challenging traditional classifications and offering a more nuanced understanding of cellular identities and functions. These insights are essential for constructing more accurate models of how life operates at a cellular level.\nMany of the examples shown in Figs. Figure 2.1–Figure 2.2 are basic biology questions. Two additional examples are shown in Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: How do cancer cells survive successive therapies? (Schaff et al. 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: What deteriorates in a cell as it ages (Silva and Schumacher 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Benchside-to-bedside applications\nSingle-cell data have enormous potential to revolutionize clinical practice by bridging molecular biology and medicine. After learning basic biology, the next stage is to use our newfound understanding to advance treatments. (We typically call this translation research, to denote translating our basic biology knowledge to therapeutic improvements.) This is also called benchside (for the wet-bench, i.e. laboratory setting) to bedside (for the hospital setting).\nBy mapping cellular heterogeneity in diseased and healthy tissues, researchers can identify specific cell populations driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. For example, in cancer, single-cell analyses have uncovered rare tumor subclones that evade treatment, providing critical targets for drug development. Similarly, in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, single-cell profiling of synovial tissues has identified inflammatory cell states that correlate with disease severity and treatment response. Beyond diagnostics, this technology enables precision medicine by tailoring treatments to the molecular profiles of individual patients. As single-cell approaches continue to evolve, they are poised to refine drug-discovery pipelines, improve vaccine design, and ultimately transform how diseases are diagnosed and treated.\nThere are a few ways this typically happens. Figure 2.10 shows one example, where single-cell research helps identify the specific cell types and specific edits needed to improve cellular function. Figure 2.11 shows another example, where understanding the cellular functions, we can improve how conventional methods can be used to measure more accurate biomarkers. Cancer research has been (by far) the biggest beneficiary of single-cell research, and Figure 2.12 illustrates how single-cell improves cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: There are current single-cell therapies that involve extracting blood from a donor, altering the cells outside the body, and then infusing the altered blood back into the donor. (Source: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/crispr-cancer-research-treatment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: After learning the causal mechanisms for specific cell types for Alzheimer’s disease that can be detected from blood draws, we can refine existing biomarkers to monitor Alzheimer’s. (Hansson et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Example of how insights from single-cell studies transform cancer therapies. (Gohil et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 What existed prior to single-cell data?\nWestern blots and flow cytometry.\nBefore the advent of single-cell technologies, biological research relied heavily on methods like western blots and flow cytometry to study cells and molecules. Western blotting (shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14), developed in the late 1970 s, enabled researchers to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample, providing insights into cellular pathways and protein-expression levels. However, this technique required lysing entire tissues or cell populations, averaging the signals from thousands or millions of cells. Flow cytometry (shown in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16), emerging in the 1980s, represented a major step forward by allowing researchers to analyse individual cells’ physical and chemical characteristics in suspension. While flow cytometry offered single-cell resolution, it was limited to analysing predefined markers and could not capture the full complexity of cellular states or gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Illustration of the Western-blot technique. (Source: https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/western-blotting-electrophoresis-techniques)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Example Western-blot data. (Kepchia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Illustration of flow-cytometry technique. (Source: https://www.streck.com/blog/principles-of-flow-cytometry/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Example flow-cytometry data. (Verschoor et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\nMicroarray technology.\nThe 1990s marked the rise of microarray technology (shown in Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18), which allowed scientists to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Microarrays revolutionised transcriptomics by enabling high-throughput studies of gene activity in various conditions, tissues, and diseases. Despite its transformative impact, microarray analysis was fundamentally a bulk method, averaging signals across all cells in a sample. It is also based on light intensity, which can be tricky to extract consistently. These limitations obscured cellular heterogeneity, especially in complex tissues where distinct cell types or states contribute uniquely to biological processes or disease mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Illustration of microarray technique. (Source: https://www.onlinebiologynotes.com/dna-microarray-principle-types-and-steps-involved-in-cdna-microarrays/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Example microarray image prior to quantification. (Source: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat555/node/28/)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: the close history between microarrays and high-dimensional statistics).\nHistorically, the rise of microarray data spurred advances in high-dimensional statistics — e.g. the Lasso (Tibshirani et al. 2005), gene-expression classification for leukaemia (Golub et al. 1999), and empirical-Bayes multiple testing (Efron and Tibshirani 2002).\n\nBulk sequencing technologies.\nIn the 2000s, bulk sequencing technologies for DNA and RNA emerged, further advancing the study of genomes and transcriptomes. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) became a powerful tool for capturing the entire transcriptome with greater accuracy and dynamic range than microarrays. Similarly, DNA sequencing enabled comprehensive studies of genetic variation, from point mutations to structural alterations. However, like microarrays, bulk sequencing aggregated signals across many cells, masking rare cell populations and the heterogeneity critical to understanding dynamic processes such as tumour evolution or immune responses. These bulk techniques laid the groundwork for single-cell methods by driving innovations in high-throughput sequencing and data analysis, which would later be adapted for single-cell resolution.",

    "text": "2.3 When did single-cell data become popular, and how has the technology advanced?\n\n2.3.1 The rise of single-cell data\nSingle-cell data began gaining prominence in the early 2010s, fuelled by advances in microfluidics and next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), pioneered around 2009 – 2011, was among the first methods to achieve widespread adoption. It enabled measurement of gene expression in individual cells, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk analyses masked. Early applications revealed new cell types and states, reshaped our understanding of development, and identified rare populations in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Popularity grew as throughput increased, costs fell, and workflows became standardised.\nFigure 2.19 and Figure 2.20 contrasts bulk and single-cell sequencing. Figure 2.21 shows how single-cell data tease apart different sources of heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: Illustrations of how single-cell sequencing improves resolution for studying cancer resistance.

Single-cell proteomics allows detailed analysis of protein expression and signalling pathways. Single-cell ATAC-seq profiles chromatin accessibility; Hi-C and related methods reveal 3D genome architecture. Spatial transcriptomics connects gene expression with tissue context. CRISPR-based single-cell screens enable high-throughput perturbations, and lineage-tracing barcodes add a temporal dimension, charting cell ancestry in development and disease. Together, these advances transformed single-cell biology into a multi-dimensional, integrative discipline.\nMany of these technologies appear in Figure 2.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Illustration (circa 2020) of technologies that pair various omics at single-cell resolution.

    "text": "2.4 What is the role of a biostatistician in a wet-lab / clinical world?\nCell biology is vast – especially for students trained primarily in statistics or biostatistics. Many disciplines intersect with cell biology. For example:\n\nStatistics / Biostatistics – statistical models for complex biological processes; translation between maths and biology\nComputational biology – scalable computation, leveraging public data\nBioinformatics / Genetics – tools that draw on large‐consortium resources\nEpidemiology – population-level data and policy recommendations\nBioengineering – new laboratory technologies for cheaper/faster measurement or imaging\nBiology – mechanistic studies in model organisms\nBiochemistry / Molecular biology – structure, function, interactions of specific molecules\nWet-bench medicine – disease mechanisms via tissues, models, cell lines\nClinical-facing medicine – patient treatment and real-world sample collection\nPharmacology – integrating evidence to design new drugs and therapies\n\nGiven so many players, what does a biostatistician contribute?\n\n2.4.1 How a biostatistician perceives the world\nGive me a concrete (ideally cleaned) dataset: the larger the better—and I will analyse it from many angles.\nCausality: A mathematically stricter notion than correlation, usually via (1) counterfactual reasoning, or (2) a directed-acyclic-graph picture of how variables relate.\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: statistical causality for cell biology is extremely difficult). Obstacles: (i) tracking the same cell over time is impossible because sequencing lyses it; (ii) longitudinal human tissue samples are rare. Strong modelling assumptions can help but must withstand biological scrutiny. The bottleneck is often data, not maths—ambitious statisticians who learn enough biology still have a fighting chance.\n\n\nRemark (Single-cell methods are largely an “associative” world): Most single-cell analyses discover mechanisms that are statistically correlational; the causal proof comes from experiments and biology.\n\nThe research inquiry starts and ends with a method: (How to integrate modalities? learn a gene-regulatory network? perform valid post-clustering tests?) Start with a statistical model and a parameter of interest \\(\\theta^*\\), then typically:\n\nDevelop a novel estimator of \\(\\theta^*\\), explaining why current methods fail (e.g. lack robustness, accuracy, power, or are heuristic). Focus on statistical logic: A clear, simple mathematical intuition should show the gap and how the new method fills it.\nProve theorems showing the estimate \\(\\hat\\theta\\) converges to \\(\\theta^*\\) under stated assumptions. Focus on consistency & convergence: More data should provably yield more accurate results (often the highlight of a statistics paper).\nSimulations demonstrating that when the true \\(\\theta^*\\) is known, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) beats competing estimators across many settings. Illustration via benchmarking: Empirically recover the correct answer more often than existing methods.\nReal-data demonstration showing results align with known biology or provide biologically sensible new insights. Focus on practicality: The method must work in real scenarios mirroring its target audience.\n\nMindset: deliver a reliable tool that others can trust as-is. Human validations are often impractical; guard-rails and diagnostics are vital.\nWhy biostatisticians need wet-lab biologists / clinicians: We rarely generate data ourselves, so collaborators supply (i) exciting data with novel questions, (ii) biological context for sensible assumptions, and (iii) experimental validation of statistical findings.\n\n\n2.4.2 How a wet-lab biologist / clinician perceives the world\nExperiments, experiments, experiments: Carefully controlled—even if small—to make downstream analysis straightforward.\nCausality comes from a chain of experiments. Suppose we study a gene’s role in disease:\n\nTemporal evidence, such as change in gene expression preceding a change in cell phenotype. A causal mechanism should occur before the phenotype.\nBiological logic providing explanation of the underlying mechanism (binding factors, protein function, evolutionary rationale, etc.). For example, there must be a coherent pathway from gene → protein → phenotype.\nUniversality of how the described association persists across cell lines or organisms. A causal mechanism should be discoverable in other systems (extent depends on how general the logic is). This is offten the highlight of a biology paper.\nValidation, such as knocking out the gene alters the outcome, whereas similar genes do not. For example, perturbing the specific gene (not its close counterparts) changes the outcome.\n\nInquiry starts and ends with a biological hypothesis: Large intellectual effort goes into proposing explanations and designing experiments to rule them in or out.\nMindset: Assemble overwhelming evidence for a mechanism, combining careful experiments and biological logic.\nWhy wet-lab scientists need biostatisticians: Data are now complex and plentiful; exhaustive experiments for every hypothesis are infeasible. Statistical methods can (i) account for data & biological complexity and (ii) prioritise hypotheses worth experimental investment.\n\nSo how does a biostatistician develop computational / statistical methods for cell biology?\n\n\nBiological context – What is the biological system and the “north-star” question? Which premises are accepted, which ones are to be tested, and why is it important to understand this mechanism better?\nTechnology, experiment, data – How are data collected and why did you choose this particular {technology, experiment, data} trio? What technical artefacts arise?\nBoundaries of current tools – Simple analyses first: what “breaks” in existing workflows? Is there preliminary evidence a new computational method would do better?\nStatistical model – What is the insight that a different computational method could interrogate the biology better? (Here the statistics training begins.)\nDevelop a method & show robustness – Robustness can be defined numerically (i.e., noise tolerance) or biologically (i.e., applicable across contexts/environments). Often, the biological question you study lacks a ground truth, so validity arguments lean on biological logic.\nUncover new / refined biology – Does the method advance our biological understanding? How confident are we that findings generalise beyond the original {technology, experiment, data} trio? (This is usually the crown-jewel of your computational biology paper – it’s not necessary your specific analyses, but the potential that your tool can be used on other biological studies beyond what you’ve demonstrated your method on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfron, Bradley, and Robert Tibshirani. 2002. “Empirical Bayes Methods and False Discovery Rates for Microarrays.” Genetic Epidemiology 23 (1): 70–86.\n\n\nGohil, Satyen H, J Bryan Iorgulescu, David A Braun, Derin B Keskin, and Kenneth J Livak. 2021. “Applying High-Dimensional Single-Cell Technologies to the Analysis of Cancer Immunotherapy.” Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology 18 (4): 244–56.\n\n\nGolub, Todd R, Donna K Slonim, Pablo Tamayo, Christine Huard, Michelle Gaasenbeek, Jill P Mesirov, Hilary Coller, et al. 1999. “Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring.” Science 286 (5439): 531–37.\n\n\nHansson, Oskar, Kaj Blennow, Henrik Zetterberg, and Jeffrey Dage. 2023. “Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in Clinical Practice and Trials.” Nature Aging 3 (5): 506–19.\n\n\nKepchia, Devin, Ling Huang, Richard Dargusch, Robert A Rissman, Maxim N Shokhirev, Wolfgang Fischer, and David Schubert. 2020. “Diverse Proteins Aggregate in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease Brain.” Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy 12: 1–20.\n\n\nLei, Yalan, Rong Tang, Jin Xu, Wei Wang, Bo Zhang, Jiang Liu, Xianjun Yu, and Si Shi. 2021. “Applications of Single-Cell Sequencing in Cancer Research: Progress and Perspectives.” Journal of Hematology & Oncology 14 (1): 91.\n\n\nSchaff, Dylan L, Aria J Fasse, Phoebe E White, Robert J Vander Velde, and Sydney M Shaffer. 2024. “Clonal Differences Underlie Variable Responses to Sequential and Prolonged Treatment.” Cell Systems 15 (3): 213–26.\n\n\nShalek, Alex K, and Mikael Benson. 2017. “Single-Cell Analyses to Tailor Treatments.” Science Translational Medicine 9 (408): eaan4730.\n\n\nSilva, Paulo FL da, and Björn Schumacher. 2021. “Principles of the Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Aging.” Journal of Investigative Dermatology 141 (4): 951–60.\n\n\nTeichmann, Sarah, and Mirjana Efremova. 2020. “Method of the Year 2019: Single-Cell Multimodal Omics.” Nature Methods 17 (1): 2020.\n\n\nTibshirani, Robert, Michael Saunders, Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, and Keith Knight. 2005. “Sparsity and Smoothness via the Fused Lasso.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology 67 (1): 91–108.\n\n\nVerschoor, Chris P, Alina Lelic, Jonathan L Bramson, and Dawn ME Bowdish. 2015. “An Introduction to Automated Flow Cytometry Gating Tools and Their Implementation.” Frontiers in Immunology 6: 380.\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

    "text": "3.1 The sparse count matrix and the negative binomial\nAt the heart of single-cell sequencing data lies the sparse count matrix, where rows represent genes, columns represent cells, and entries capture the number of sequencing reads (or molecules) detected for each gene in each cell. This matrix is typically sparse because most genes are not expressed in any given cell, leading to a prevalence of zeros. The data’s sparsity reflects both the biological reality of selective gene expression and technical limitations such as sequencing depth. To model the variability in these counts, the negative binomial distribution is often employed. This distribution accommodates overdispersion, where the observed variability in gene expression counts exceeds what would be expected under simpler models like the Poisson distribution. By accounting for both biological heterogeneity and technical noise, the negative binomial provides a robust framework for analyzing sparse single-cell data.\nLet \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) denote the single-cell data matrix with \\(n\\) cells (rows) and \\(p\\) features (columns). In a single-cell RNA-seq data matrix, the \\(p\\) features represent the \\(p\\) genes.\nHere are some basic statistics about these matrices (based mainly from my experience):\nBased on these observations, the negative binomial distribution is very commonly used.\nThe negative binomial (NB) distribution is a widely used model in single-cell RNA-seq analysis due to its ability to handle overdispersion, which is common in gene expression data. Overdispersion occurs when the variance of the data exceeds the mean, a phenomenon that cannot be captured by the Poisson distribution. The NB distribution introduces an additional parameter to model this extra variability, making it more flexible for single-cell data.\nLet us focus on the count for cell \\(i\\) and gene \\(j\\), i.e., the value \\(X_{ij}\\). The probability mass function (pmf) of the NB distribution for a random variable ( X_{ij} ) is given by:\n\\[\nP(X_{ij} = k) = \\binom{k + r_j - 1}{k} p_{ij}^r (1 - p_{ij})^k, \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere \\(r_j \\&gt; 0\\) is the dispersion (or “overdispersion”) parameter and \\(p\\_{ij} \\in (0, 1)\\) is the probability of success. This is the “standard” parameterization, mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution. This specific parameterization is actually not very commonly used.\nAlternatively, the NB distribution is most commonly parameterized in terms of the mean \\(\\mu_{ij}\\) and the dispersion parameter \\(r_j\\), which is often preferred in single-cell analysis:\n\\[\n\\text{Mean: } \\mu_{ij}, \\quad \\text{Variance: } \\mu_{ij} + \\frac{\\mu_{ij}^2}{r_j} = \\mu_{ij}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu_{ij}}{r_j}\\right).\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\n(Compare these relations to the Poisson distribution, where both the mean and variance would be \\(\\mu_{ij}\\).)\nTo relate equation Equation 3.1 to Equation 3.2, observe that we can derive,\n\\[\n\\mu_{ij} = \\frac{r_j (1 - p_{ij})}{p_{ij}}.\n\\]\nWe typically use a different overdispersion parameter \\(r_j\\) for each gene \\(j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\). Here, \\(r_j\\) controls the degree of overdispersion. When \\(r_j \\to \\infty\\), the variance approaches the mean, and the NB distribution converges to the Poisson distribution. For single-cell RNA-seq data, the introduction of \\(r_j\\) allows the model to capture both the biological variability between cells and technical noise, making it robust to the sparse and overdispersed nature of gene expression data.",

    "text": "For \\(n\\), we usually have 10,000 to 500,000 cells. These cells originate from a specific set of samples/donors/organisms1. See ?fig-lupus and ?fig-zebrafish for larger examples of single-cell datasets.\n\nFor \\(p\\), we usually have about 30,000 genes (but as you’ll see, we usually limit the analysis to 2000 to 5000 genes chosen from this full set).2\n\nIn a typical scRNA-seq matrix, more than 70% of the elements are exactly 0. (And among the remaining 30%, typically half are exactly 1. The maximum count can be in the hundreds, i.e., the distribution is extremely right-skewed.) This is illustrated in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2. We’ll see later in ?sec-scrnaseq_tech where these “counts” come from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Illustration of data from https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html showing a snippet of the count matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of data from https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html showing the percentage of cells with non-zero counts for each gene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would genes even have different overdispersions? We’re assuming in most statistical models that: 1) genes are modeled as a negative binomial random variable, and 2) genes have different overdispersion parameters \\(r_j\\). Why is this reasonable? Is there a biomolecular reason for this?\nWe draw upon (sarkar2021separating?), explaining how the NB distribution is justified (both theoretically and empirically) for scRNA-seq data. After reading this paper, you’ll see that the overdispersion originates from the “biological noise” (i.e., the Gamma distribution). This differs from gene to gene because gene expression is subject to many aspects: transcriptomic bursting, the proximity between the gene and the promoter, the mRNA stability and degradation, copy number variation, the cell cycle stage, etc.\n\n\n3.1.0.1 How do you estimate the overdispersion parameter in practice?\nThe easiest way is to use MASS::glm.nb in R. However, this is very noisy for single-cell data (see Remark 3.1). Since we are estimate one dispersion parameter per gene, many methods use an Empirical Bayes framework to “smooth” the overdispersion parameters (love2014moderated?). More sophisticated methods (such as SCTransform (hafemeister2019normalization?)) use the Bioconductor R package called glmGamPoi. Deep-learning methods simply incorporate estimating the dispersion parameter into the architecture and objective function, see scVI (lopez2018deep?).\nAlso, note that which we are assuming here that the overdispersion parameter \\(r_j\\) is shared across all the cells for gene \\(j\\), there are methods that also use different overdispersion parameters for different cell populations. See (chen2018umi?) or the dispersion parameter in scVI (see https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/api/reference/scvi.model.SCVI.html#scvi.model.SCVI). In general, using different overdispersion parameters for the same gene across different cell populations is not common, so my suggestion is to: 1) have a diagnostic in mind on how would you know if need to use different overdispersion parameters for the same gene, and then 2) try analyzing the genes where each gene only has one overdispersion parameter and see if you have enough concrete evidence that such a model was too simplistic.\n\nPersonal opinion: My preferred parameterization The formulation Equation 3.2 by far is the most common way people write the NB distribution. We typically call \\(r_j\\) the “overdispersion” parameter, since the inclusion of \\(r_j\\) in our modeling is typically to denote that there is more variance than a Poisson. I personally don’t like it because I find it confusing that a larger \\(r_j\\) denotes a distribution with smaller variance. Hence, I usually write the variance as \\(\\mu_{ij}(1+\\alpha_j \\mu_{ij})\\) (where \\(\\alpha_j = 1/r_j\\)). This way, \\(\\alpha_j = 0\\) is a Poisson distribution. However, even though this makes more sense to me, it’s not commonly used. (It’s because this parameterization makes it confusing to work with the exponential-family distributions mathematically.)\nThe main takeaway is to always pay close attention to each paper’s NB parameterization. You’re looking for the mean-variance relation written somewhere in the paper to ensure you understand the author’s notation.\n\n\nRemark 3.1. What makes the negative binomial tricky Let me use an analogy that is based on the more familiar coin toss. Suppose 30 people each are given a weighted coin where the probability of heads is \\(10^{-9}\\) (basically, it’s impossible to get a heads). Everyone coerce and agree to a secret number \\(N\\), and everyone independently flips their own coin \\(N\\) times and records the number of heads. I (the moderator) do not know \\(N\\), but I get to see how many heads each person got during this experiment. My goal is to estimate \\(N\\). What makes this problem very difficult?\nIf \\(N\\) were 10, or 100, or maybe even 10,000, almost everyone would get 0 heads. That is, we cannot reliably estimate \\(N\\) since the log-likelihood function is very flat. The issue is because count data has a finite resolution — 0 is always the smallest possible value, and 1 is always the second smallest value. Hence, unlike continuous values (which have “infinite resolution” in some sense), non-negative integers “lose” information the smaller the range is.",

    "text": "5.1 Review of the central dogma\nThe central dogma of molecular biology outlines the flow of genetic information within a cell: DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is then translated into protein (see Figure 5.1). Specifically, coding genes in DNA are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which serves as a template for protein synthesis. During translation, mRNA sequences are read in sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each corresponding to a specific amino acid. These amino acids are then linked together to form proteins, which carry out a vast array of functions within the cell. While this process provides a foundational framework, it is a dramatic over-simplification. As we’ll explore later in the course, the correlation between a gene and its corresponding protein levels is often surprisingly low, highlighting the complexity of gene expression regulation.\nUnderstanding proteins is crucial because they are the primary effectors of cellular function. Most cellular activities — whether structural, enzymatic, or signaling—are mediated by proteins. While RNA intermediates, such as mRNA, play important roles in carrying genetic information, the majority of RNA fragments never leave the cell, with a few exceptions like extracellular RNA in communication. Proteins, however, directly influence both intracellular processes and extracellular interactions. Given the weak correlation between genes and proteins and the central role proteins play in biological function, studying proteins arguably provides a more direct and meaningful insight into cellular and organismal behavior. This dual perspective on the central dogma will frame much of our exploration in this course.1",

Historically, determining protein shapes required experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (EM) (see Figure 5.5), or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which are resource-intensive and time-consuming. AlphaFold uses deep learning and structural biology insights to achieve high accuracy.\nHowever, significant challenges remain. There are still many open questions on how specific genetic modifications impact protein folding, how proteins dynamically change their conformation, or how they interact with other molecules such as DNA or other proteins. Additionally, ongoing developments in using large language models are showing promise in predicting not only shape but also potential functions directly from amino acid sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: From (jumper2021highly?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: From https://myscope.training/CRYO_Introducing_Single_Particle_Analysis, as an example of what cryo-EM data “looks like,” just to give you a brief glimpse on how people study protein structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Other Methods: Flow Cytometry, Spatial Proteomics, and FISH\nWhile AlphaFold focuses on protein structure, methods like flow cytometry and spatial proteomics explore proteins in their functional and cellular contexts. Flow cytometry, sometimes considered the “original” single-cell data method, measures the expression of surface and intracellular proteins across thousands of cells, providing rich insights into cellular heterogeneity. Spatial proteomics and techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) take this further by localizing proteins and RNA within tissue contexts, enabling researchers to map molecular interactions in their native environments. These approaches highlight the versatility of protein studies, from understanding their structure to dissecting their function and distribution in complex systems. While not the focus of this course, these methods are invaluable in expanding our understanding of proteins and their roles in biology.",

While every cell in an organism typically contains the same genome, different cells exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions. This diversity arises not from changes in the underlying DNA sequence but from epigenetic regulation—heritable modifications that influence gene expression without altering the DNA itself. Epigenetics includes processes like DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin accessibility, all of which contribute to the dynamic regulation of gene activity in response to developmental cues and environmental signals.\nEnhancers play a critical role in this regulatory landscape. These are DNA sequences that, while not coding for proteins themselves, can dramatically increase the transcription of target genes. Enhancers act by binding specific transcription factors, proteins that recognize and attach to DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. Some transcription factors require assistance from chaperone proteins, which ensure their proper folding and functionality, or pioneer proteins, which can access and open tightly packed chromatin to allow other factors to bind. This interplay highlights the complexity of the regulatory machinery that governs cellular function. See Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 to appreciate how complex this machinery is.",

    "text": "6.2 The zoo of epigenetic modalities\nEpigenetics encompasses a vast array of molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These mechanisms include modifications to DNA, RNA, chromatin, and the spatial organization of the genome, collectively forming a complex regulatory landscape. Below are some of the key modalities studied in epigenetics:\n\nDNA Accessibility: Techniques like ATAC-seq and DNase-seq measure how accessible DNA is to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Accessible regions often overlap with promoters and enhancers, providing critical insights into gene regulation. (This is what we’ll focus on this chapter.)\nDNA Methylation1: This modification, typically at cytosines in CpG dinucleotides, is a key epigenetic mark associated with gene silencing. Tools like bisulfite sequencing are used to map methylation patterns across the genome, revealing their roles in development and disease. See Figure 6.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: From Gauba et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: From Bruggeman-Everts (2008).\n\n\n\n\n\nHi-C and Genome Organization2: Hi-C measures chromatin interactions to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the genome. It uncovers features like topologically associating domains (TADs) and enhancer-promoter loops, which are crucial for understanding how spatial organization influences gene regulation. See Figure 6.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: From Ea et al. (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: From N. Liu et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nHistone Modifications3: Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, occur on histone proteins and regulate chromatin structure. Techniques like ChIP-seq and the newer Cut & Tag method are used to map these modifications and their role in gene expression at the bulk level. See Figure 6.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: From https://opened.cuny.edu/courseware/lesson/684/student/?section=2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: From Steinbach (2017). (Note: This is an example of the “canonical” functions of common histone modifications. This is by no means exhaustive and guaranteed to hold true for all biological systems.)\n\n\n\n\nSome of you might be interested: Personally, I think one of the fascinating concepts based on histone modifications is bivalent chromatin (essentially, chromatin that is wrapped in such a way that is simultaneously activated and silenced), see Figure 6.9. It’s a particularly curious phenomenon that entire labs dedicate themselves to studying. See Blanco et al. (2020) for an overview why this mechanism might be “beneficial.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: From Macrae, Fothergill-Robinson, and Ramalho-Santos (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: From Glancy, Choy, and Eckersley-Maslin (2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA Modifications (m6A and Pseudouridine): Modifications like N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and pseudouridine occur on RNA molecules and are involved in processes like splicing, translation, and mRNA decay. See Figure 6.11 for what pseudouridine is, i.e., “a rotation of the uridine molecule.” These modifications add an epitranscriptomic layer to gene regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: From Hamma and Ferré-D’Amaré (2006) about pseudouridine.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntranslated Regions (UTRs): Before talking about UTRs, it’s probably good to review what an mRNA fragment “looks like” at the different stages of transcription and translation, see Figure 6.12. The 5′ and 3′ UTRs contain regulatory elements that influence mRNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency. The 3′ UTR, in particular, serves as a binding platform for RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, providing an additional layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: From Niazi (2023). Notice the splicing (i.e., “removal” of the introns – see Alternative Splicing below) and that the protein-coding region is not the only part of the mRNA transcript – there are also the UTRs and poly-A tail. NOTE: The transcription start site (TSS) is not the same place as the promoter. The promoter is usually an un-transcribed region upstream of the TSS, while the TSS is where transcription actually starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: From Mignone et al. (2002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: From https://www.cambio.co.uk/9/257/applications/methods/in-vitro-transcription/mrna-therapeutics/.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Splicing: This post-transcriptional process generates multiple mRNA isoforms from the same gene, expanding the proteomic diversity, see Figure 6.15. This is a combinatorial explosion of isoforms. While not traditionally classified as epigenetic, splicing often intersects with chromatin modifications and RNA-binding proteins, blurring the lines between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: From J. Chen and Weiss (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Polyadenylation (APA): APA generates transcript isoforms with different 3′ ends, affecting mRNA stability, localization, and translation, see Figure 6.16. By selecting distinct cleavage sites, APA alters the 3′ UTR length without affecting the poly-A tail itself, thereby modulating interactions with regulatory factors such as microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.16: From L. Li et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\nEfforts like the ENCODE project (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7061942/) have systematically mapped these modalities across cell types and tissues, creating a comprehensive resource for understanding genome function. ENCODE has provided invaluable datasets on DNA accessibility, histone modifications, and RNA-binding proteins, enabling researchers to uncover how epigenetic and transcriptomic layers work together to drive cellular processes.\nFinally, tools like MPRA (Massively Parallel Reporter Assays) are revolutionizing how we study enhancers and regulatory sequences. MPRA allows researchers to test thousands of DNA fragments for their regulatory activity, providing functional validation for epigenetic marks. This growing zoo of modalities continues to expand our understanding of how the genome is dynamically regulated in health and disease.\nSee Figure 6.17 for some courageous figures that try to display multiple types of epigenetic modifications all at once.

    "text": "7.1 Genetics 101\nUnderstanding the fundamental concepts of genetics is essential for studying genomic variation, including copy-number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This section provides an overview of genetic architecture, SNPs and their detection, commonly sequenced tissues, and genome annotation resources such as the UCSC Genome Browser.\nSingle Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and Their Detection.\nA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a variation at a single base pair position in the genome that is present in a significant fraction of the population. SNPs are the most common type of genetic variation and can have functional consequences depending on their location. When an SNP occurs within a coding region, it may alter the resulting protein sequence if it leads to an amino acid substitution (nonsynonymous SNP) or have no effect if the change is synonymous. SNPs in noncoding regions can impact gene regulation by affecting transcription factor binding sites, splicing efficiency, or untranslated regions (UTRs). Since you have “two copies” of each of your 23 chromosomes, this means SNP data is a data matrix of \\(n\\) people by \\(p\\) SNP regions (think of a couple million – more on this technicality later), where each value is \\(\\{0,1,2\\}\\), see Figure 7.1. Typically, the major allele is defined as “0”, and a “1” or “2” means if how many copies of the minor allele do you have.\nSNPs are detected using high-throughput sequencing technologies, primarily whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES). In these approaches, DNA is extracted from a biological sample, fragmented, and sequenced to generate short or long reads. The raw sequencing reads are then aligned to a reference genome, and variant calling algorithms such as those implemented in GATK (mckenna2010genome?), bcftools, and FreeBayes (garrison2012haplotype?) identify SNPs by comparing observed nucleotide differences to the reference sequence. (See (zverinova2022variant?) for a overview). The sequencing depth, or coverage, at a given genomic position determines the confidence in an SNP call, with higher coverage reducing the likelihood of sequencing errors.",

Originally derived from the bacterial adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas9 has been repurposed for genetic engineering by using a guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific genomic locus for targeted DNA cleavage. This section discusses how CRISPR is performed in the wet lab, different functional applications of CRISPR, and how CRISPR-based perturbations are analyzed in single-cell gene expression studies.\nIn a typical CRISPR screen experiment (mainly a CRISPR knockout), a library of lentivirus-packaged guide RNAs is introduced into cells under conditions designed to infect each cell with only one or a few sgRNAs (single guide RNA), see Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2. After selection to ensure stable integration, the cells are subjected to a particular stimulus such as drug treatment or other environmental challenge. Researchers then track the abundance of each sgRNA at the start and after the stimulus (for example, at day 0 and day 28) through next-generation sequencing. By comparing which sgRNAs become enriched or depleted, it is possible to discover genes essential for viability, pathways governing drug resistance, or other critical biological functions relevant to the phenotype under study, see Figure 8.3.",

Understanding where specific cell populations reside within a tumor and how they interact with stromal and immune cells can reveal mechanisms of resistance and potential therapeutic targets.\nDevelopmental biology: Spatial positioning dictates lineage specification and organ formation, where disruptions in cell placement can lead to congenital defects. We can also overlay the gene expression at each spatial location with other imaging technologies or our current understanding of the structure of an organ, see Figure 10.3.

By integrating spatial data with single-cell transcriptomics, researchers can infer functional relationships between different cell types, uncovering regulatory networks that drive biological processes.\nNote: Spatial information in cell biology has been studied for decades, long before single-cell sequencing became commercially feasible. Techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have been used to visualize the spatial localization of specific RNA molecules within cells, providing crucial insights into gene expression patterns. Microscopy-based methods, including confocal and super-resolution imaging, have also been instrumental in understanding cellular structures and interactions. The key novelty of modern spatial transcriptomics is its ability to scale these analyses – rather than measuring just a few genes at a time, we can now capture the spatial expression patterns of hundreds to thousands of genes simultaneously, enabling a much more comprehensive view of cellular organization and function.",

    "text": "6.4 10x Multiome – Joint profiling of chromatin accessibility and RNA\nThe 10x Multiome allows researchers to simultaneously profile gene expression (RNA) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC) at the single-cell level. This provides a comprehensive view of transcriptional and regulatory states within the same cells, enabling deeper insights into gene regulation and cell type characterization.\n\n6.4.1 Primer on chromatin accessibility and “peaks”\nChromatin accessibility refers to the degree to which DNA is physically accessible to regulatory proteins such as transcription factors, RNA polymerase, and other elements of the transcriptional machinery. In eukaryotic cells, DNA is wrapped around histone proteins to form chromatin, which can exist in a closed or open state. Open chromatin regions are more likely to contain active regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, while closed chromatin regions are generally associated with transcriptional repression. Profiling chromatin accessibility provides insights into which regulatory elements are active in a given cell state, offering a complementary perspective to RNA-seq data.\nIn single-cell ATAC-seq experiments, accessible chromatin regions are identified as peaks, which represent DNA regions where the transposase enzyme preferentially inserts sequencing adapters. These peaks correspond to genomic loci where nucleosomes are absent or displaced, indicating active regulatory sites. Peaks are typically mapped to gene promoters, enhancers, or other functional elements to infer regulatory activity. By integrating chromatin accessibility with gene expression data from the same cells, 10x Multiome enables researchers to connect regulatory regions with their target genes, uncovering how chromatin structure influences transcriptional programs and cell fate decisions.\nThe resulting data often looks like Figure 6.19, where, for each genomic region, you can define “peaks” where there are regions of accessible DNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.19: From https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/mouse_brain_vignette. The gray bars on the bottom (i.e., “Peaks”) are derived based on the tracks shown up top (in different colors, based on the average accessibility at each base pair of the reference DNA for different cells of various cell types). The blue horizon bar (i.e., “Genes”) tells you roughly where the introns and exons of a particular gene is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4.2 Brief description of the technology\nThe following are the high-level steps involved in performing single-cell multiome sequencing using the 10x Genomics Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression platform:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.20: From Buenrostro et al.

Cells are isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or other methods to ensure viable, intact cells for profiling both RNA and chromatin.\nTransposition and RNA Capture:\nCells are incubated with a transposase enzyme that fragments DNA in open chromatin regions and tags them with sequencing adapters. Simultaneously, RNA is captured via hybridization to barcoded beads containing poly(dT) sequences, enabling downstream transcriptomic profiling.\nDroplet Generation:\nUsing the 10x Chromium instrument, individual cells are encapsulated into oil-based droplets along with barcoded gel beads. Each bead contains unique barcodes for both RNA and chromatin, ensuring that data from both modalities are linked to the same cell.\nReverse Transcription and Transposition Amplification:\nRNA is reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) within the droplets. Transposed DNA fragments are amplified via PCR to enrich for regions of open chromatin.\nDroplet Breakage and Cleanup:\nDroplets are broken, and the barcoded nucleic acids are recovered. Separate workflows are used to process RNA-derived cDNA and transposed DNA fragments.\nLibrary Preparation:\nThe cDNA and DNA libraries are prepared in parallel:\n\nRNA Library: Includes additional steps for amplification and adapter ligation to finalize the gene expression library.\nATAC Library: Focuses on chromatin accessibility, with library preparation steps optimized for sequencing transposed DNA.\n\nHigh-Throughput Sequencing:\nThe prepared RNA and ATAC libraries are sequenced on an Illumina platform, typically with paired-end reads to capture both transcriptomic and chromatin information.\nData Alignment and Integration:\nSequencing reads are mapped to the genome, with RNA reads assigned to transcripts and ATAC reads aligned to open chromatin regions. Barcode information is used to link the RNA and chromatin profiles back to individual cells, enabling multi-modal analyses.\n\nBrief note about peak-calling.\nPeak-calling is the computational process of identifying regions of open chromatin from ATAC-seq data, where transposase insertion events are enriched. These peaks represent accessible regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers, and transcription factor binding sites. Peak-calling algorithms, such as MACS2 or the cellranger-atac pipeline (see Figure 6.22), detect significant enrichments in sequencing reads while accounting for background noise and sequencing biases. In single-cell ATAC-seq, peak-calling is often performed at the population level or adapted to sparse single-cell data by aggregating similar cells. Accurate peak-calling is essential for interpreting chromatin accessibility patterns and linking regulatory regions to gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.22: From https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger-arc/latest/algorithms-overview/algorithms-overview. You can see that ATAC-seq measures these DNA fragments, and a “peak” is a computational object that denotes a high concentration of overlapping fragments.\n\n\n\n\nFurther reading.\nSee Mansisidor and Risca (2022), Miao et al. (2021), Teichmann and Efremova (2020) for an in-depth dive on the biological insights from this omic (among many, many review papers). Two things are of note: 1) modeling scATAC-seq data is not as straight-forward as scRNA-seq (see Miao and Kim (2024), Martens et al. (2024)), 2) almost all the scRNA-seq methods we have discussed in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 have a counterpart developed specifically to model scATAC-seq data. For example, peakVI Ashuach et al. (2022) is a commonly used method to compute the low-dimensional embedding for scATAC-seq data.",

    "section": "6.5 ChromVAR: The most commonly used method to assess binding regions",
    "text": "6.5 ChromVAR: The most commonly used method to assess binding regions\nChromVAR (short for Chromatin Variability Across Regions, Schep et al. (2017)) is a computational tool designed to analyze chromatin accessibility data, such as those generated from ATAC-seq or single-cell ATAC-seq experiments. Its primary goal is to quantify variability in chromatin accessibility across predefined genomic regions, such as transcription factor binding motifs or enhancers, and link these patterns to regulatory factors that drive cell state differences.\nWhat the heck is a motif? A motif is a short, recurring DNA sequence pattern that is recognized and bound by specific transcription factors (TFs) to regulate gene expression, see Figure 6.23. These motifs are typically found in promoters, enhancers, and other regulatory regions of the genome. Motifs are often represented as position weight matrices (PWMs), which describe the probability of observing each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) at a given position in the sequence. Identifying motif enrichment in chromatin accessibility data helps infer which transcription factors are active in a given cell type or condition. ChromVAR leverages these motifs to assess whether specific transcription factors are driving chromatin accessibility changes, providing insights into cell-type-specific regulatory programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.23: From Habib (2007).\n\n\n\n\nSidenote about motifs. If you work on scATAC-seq or ChIP-seq data long enough, you’ll eventually need to learn about: 1) how to detect potential binding sites in your data, and 2) how to find a database of “known” motifs. For the first point, HOMER Heinz et al. (2010) is a very common bioinformatics tool. It takes in a bunch of DNA regions, and then finds DNA motifs that are significantly enriched as well as which potential TF might match those motifs, see Figure 6.24. For the second point, JASPAR is one of the more common databases of TFs, see https://jaspar.elixir.no/ and Fornes et al. (2020). In R, the Bioconductor package is called JASPAR2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.24: From http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer//motif/motifFinding.html.\n\n\n\n\nDetails of ChromVAR. ChromVAR works by computing deviation scores, which measure how much the accessibility of a given set of regions (e.g., those containing a specific transcription factor motif) varies across cells or samples. This enables the identification of transcription factors that are likely active and driving regulatory differences within the dataset. See Figure 6.25.\n\nInput/Output. The input for a ChromVAR analysis is: 1) $ _+^{np}$ for the \\(n\\) cells and \\(p\\) peaks, 2) the specific locations of the \\(p\\) peaks along the reference genome (for example, in humans, this could be the hg38 reference genome, and in R, this is typically managed by the GenomicRanges BioConductor package, and 3) a database of TF motifs, such as JASPAR. (*Technically*), you don’t actually pass Item #2 or #3 as input. ChromVAR already expects you to have matched peaks to motifs using some method, for instance, motifmatchr. This matching is where, technically, Item #2 and #3 are used.) The output is then a new matrix \\(Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}\\) where \\(d\\) is the number of TFs, and entry \\(Y_{ij}\\) denotes the excess variability of the TF \\(j\\)’s accessibility in cell \\(i\\), relative to a set of “background” DNA regions that have similar qualities as TF \\(j\\).\n\nHere’s how it works: 1. Input Data: The input consists of a binary peak-by-cell matrix (e.g., from single-cell ATAC-seq), where each entry indicates whether a specific genomic region (peak) is accessible in a given cell. A set of motif annotations (e.g., binding motifs for transcription factors) is provided to group peaks into motif-associated sets.\nImportantly: To run ChromVAR, you must have a reference genome. You are about to scan the genome for locations where a motif can bind to a particular DNA sequence in the reference genome. That is, you’re thinking about the specific base pair sequence of the DNA. 2. Region Set Aggregation: Peaks are grouped into sets based on the motifs. For each cell \\(i\\) and each motif-associated region set \\(k\\), ChromVAR computes the aggregate accessibility: \\[\n   A_{ik} = \\sum_{j \\in S_k} X_{ij},\n   \\] where \\(S_k\\) is the set of peaks \\(j\\)’s associated with motif \\(k\\).\nIn simple terms, you’re adding up all the peaks that contain a relevant motif.) This sum (for cell \\(i\\)) is normalized against all other cells (i.e., across all cells, how many counts were mapped to these peaks. 3. Sampling a set of background peaks: One of ChromVAR’s most important steps is carefully choosing a set of “background peaks,” i.e., peaks that are not the ones associated with motif \\(k\\), but have similar biological qualities. ChromVAR typically controls for two important things to do this: the GC content of a peak region and the region’s fragment length. (GC content is adjusted for since PCR tends to favor GC-rich regions.) Then, for every peak that contains motif \\(k\\), it samples many different peaks that has similar GC content and fragment length to the particular peak. This loops over all the peaks associated with motif \\(k\\), and the aggregate set of sampled peak is called the set of background peaks. 4. Deviation Scores: The deviation score quantifies how much the accessibility for a motif-associated region set deviates from what is expected under a background distribution. ChromVAR uses a binomial model to compute the expected accessibility, and the deviation score \\(D_{kj}\\) is defined as the z-score: \\[\n   Y_{ik} = \\frac{A_{ik} - \\mathbb{E}[A_{ik}]}{\\text{SD}[A_{ik}]},\n   \\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}[A_{ik}]\\) and \\(\\text{SD}[A_{ik}]\\) are the expected mean and standard deviation of the accessibility for motif \\(k\\) under the background model. This matrix \\(Y\\) (over all the cells and all motifs) is the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.25: From Schep et al. (2017)",

    "text": "6.6 Deep-learning integration and translation of RNA and ATAC\nSingle-cell multi-omic data integration is challenging due to the lack of one-to-one correspondence between cells across different assays. While many experimental technologies allow simultaneous measurement of multiple omics modalities (e.g., RNA and chromatin accessibility), most single-cell datasets include only one modality. This creates the challenge of integrating data from different omics layers with distinct feature spaces (e.g., genes in scRNA-seq vs. chromatin regions in scATAC-seq). We call this diagonal integration since we simultaneously have different cells in each dataset and different features (since these are two different omics). See Figure 6.26.\nOur goal can be thought of as one of two things (which are essentially equivalent):\n\nMatching: How do we match a cell in the first omic to the “best” corresponding cell in the second omic, so we can “pretend” we were able able to sequence paired multi-omic data?\nImputation of missing omics: For the cells where we only sequenced the first omic, can we predict what the expressions of these cells would had been if we sequenced the second omic? And vice versa, can we predict the first omic for the cells where we only sequenced the second omic?\n\nUpon first glance, it seems surprising that anyone can do you anything at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.26: From Argelaguet et al. (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.1 Strategy 1: Completely unsupervised approach to diagonal integration\nIn the first broad category we’ll talk about here, we seek to diagonally integrate \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_x \\times p_x}\\) and \\(Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_y \\times p_y}\\), two single-cell datasets on different omics (i.e., the \\(p_x\\) features in the first omic are different from the \\(p_y\\) features in the second omic). Here, we are not willing to make any biological assumptions on how these two omics are related.\nA typical choice: SCOT.\nSCOT (Single-Cell alignment with Optimal Transport) addresses diagonal integration using the Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport framework Demetci et al. (2022). The key idea is to align datasets from different modalities while preserving their intrinsic geometric structures. SCOT constructs \\(k\\)-nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs for each dataset and computes intra-domain pairwise distance matrices. The alignment is achieved by finding a probabilistic coupling matrix \\(\\mathbf{G}\\) that minimizes the discrepancy between these intra-domain distances.\n\nInput/Output. The inputs to SCOT are: 1) 2 different single-cell datasets \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_x \\times p_x}\\) and \\(Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_y \\times p_y}\\), each measuring a different omic (i.e., different features) on a different set of cells. The primary output is a matching between (not necessarily 1-to-1) cells in \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) so you computationally pretend you have paired multi-omic data for your downstream procedures.\n\n\nBrief aside on Wasserstein distance: The Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, measures the effort required to morph one probability distribution into another. This can be intuitively understood using the “moving pile of sand” analogy: given two distributions, we seek the most efficient way to move mass from one distribution to another while minimizing transportation cost.\nMathematically, given two discrete distributions \\(\\mu = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \\delta_{x_i}\\) and \\(\\nu = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} q_j \\delta_{y_j}\\), the classic optimal transport problem finds a coupling matrix \\(\\mathbf{G} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}\\) that minimizes the transport cost:\n\\[\nW_c(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min_{\\mathbf{G} \\in \\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} c(x_i, y_j) G_{ij},\n\\]\nwhere \\(c(x_i, y_j)\\) represents the cost of moving mass from \\(x_i\\) to \\(y_j\\), and \\(\\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)\\) is the set of all valid transport plans satisfying the marginal constraints:\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^{m} G_{ij} = p_i, \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{n} G_{ij} = q_j, \\quad G_{ij} \\geq 0.\n\\]\n\nThe Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance uses optimal transport by aligning the pairwise distances of cell with each omic. Given distance matrices \\(\\mathbf{D}^{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{D}^{Y}\\) for datasets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) (one for each omic), the GW problem is \\[\n\\operatorname{GW}(\\mu, \\nu) = \\min_{\\mathbf{G} \\in \\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)} \\sum_{i,k} \\sum_{j,l} L(D^X_{ik}, D^Y_{jl}) G_{ij} G_{kl},\n\\] where \\(L(D^X_{ik}, D^Y_{jl})\\) quantifies how much the transport plan distorts local geometric structures. SCOT uses this framework to learn an alignment between single-cell datasets by computing the optimal \\(\\mathbf{G}\\), followed by a barycentric projection to bring the datasets into a common space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.27: From Demetci et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple analogy: To understand SCOT, consider the following analogy. Let’s say in the first omic, we measured 4 cells: {A, B, C, D}, where we infer that cell-pairs {A,B}, {B,C}, and {A,D} are similar (based on their expression profiles in the first omic). In the second omic, we measured 4 cells: {I, II, III, IV}, where we infer that cell-pairs {II,IV}, {IV,III}, and {II,I} are similar (based on their expression profiles in the second omic). From this, we can infer that a reasonable matching is, {A, II}, {B, IV}, {C, III}, and {D,I}. You can imagine that the Wasserstein framework is apply this logic much more formally and robustly.\n\nA brief note on other approaches.\nYou’re really driving in the dark with these approaches since you’re blindly trusting that both omics have to stem “from the same manifold,” loosely speaking. This flavor of diagonal integration essentially boils down to manifold alignment – how can you “align” two different omics, where you trust that this computation alignment tells you how the two omics are aligned. (However, for certain pairs of omics, you really have no other choice, so this comment isn’t necessarily a criticism. It is more of a cautionary warning for you to think carefully on how would you even know you had a sensible integration.) A common addition in recent years for these diagonal integration methods is not to require all cells to be matched, see K. Cao, Hong, and Wan (2022). This addition complicates the computation, but enables you to allow for biological signal in one omic that is not recapitulated in the other. See Xu and McCord (2022) for more commentary.\n\n\n6.6.2 Strategy 2: Leveraging more biological information for diagonal integration\nUnlike the methods in Section 6.6.1, what if you do have biological insights about how the two omics are related? Then certainly, you should be able to perform a much more powerful diagonal integration if your biological insights are correct.\nA typical choice: GLUE.\nGraph-Linked Unified Embedding (GLUE), as the name suggests, everages prior biological knowledge to construct a guidance graph, where nodes represent features (e.g., genes or ATAC peaks) and edges represent regulatory interactions (e.g., enhancer-promoter links) Z.-J. Cao and Gao (2022). This graph links omics-specific feature spaces, enabling joint learning of regulatory relationships and cell embeddings. By combining the guidance graph with observed data, GLUE infers regulatory interactions in a Bayesian-like manner. This enables the identification of cis-regulatory relationships, such as enhancer-gene links, and provides insights into transcription factor (TF) activity.\n\nInput/Output. The inputs to GLUE are: 1) \\(K\\) different single-cell datasets \\(X^{(k)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_k \\times p_k}\\) for each \\(k \\in \\{1,\\ldots,K\\}\\), each measuring a different omic (i.e., different features) on a different set of cells, and 2) a graph \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) that connects the \\({p_k}_{k=1}^{K}\\). (This is the guidance graph, and this gets treated as another “dataset” in some sense.) The primary output is \\(\\hat{X}^{(k_1;k_2)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{k_1} \\times p_{k_2}}\\). That is, this is the “best guess” of expression in the \\((k_2)\\)-th omic for the cells in \\((k_1)\\)-th omic.\n\nImportantly, separate variational autoencoders (VAEs) are trained for each omics layer, producing omics-specific low-dimensional cell embeddings. A shared latent embedding is aligned across modalities through adversarial learning and guided by the regulatory graph.\nSome of the modeling details:\n\nGuidance Graph: Let \\(p=\\sum_{k=1}^{K}p_k\\), which denotes the total number of features across all \\(K\\) omics. The guidance graph \\(\\mathcal{G} = (\\mathcal{V}, \\mathcal{E})\\) connects features across omics layers, with edges weighted by interaction confidence, where \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) denotes all \\(p\\) features. The feature embeddings \\(V\\) are learned to reconstruct this graph, roughly:\n\n\\[\n\\log p(\\mathcal{G}  | V) = \\sum_{(i, j) \\in \\mathcal{E} } \\big[\\log \\sigma(s_{ij} v_i^\\top v_j) + \\sum_{j' : (i,j') \\notin \\mathcal{E}} \\log\\big(1-\\sigma(s_{ij'}v_i^\\top v_{j'}\\big)\\big],\n\\] where \\(\\sigma\\) is the sigmoid function, \\(s\\_{ij}\\) indicates edge polarity, and \\(v_i, v_j\\) are feature embeddings. We’ll need to learn the graph convolution network encoder to learn \\(V\\) from \\(\\mathcal{G}\\) (please see the paper for this – this is a bit complicated to explain concisely), as well as the parameters \\(\\{s_{ij}\\}_{i,j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,p\\}}\\) (which is the “decoder” for the graph, in a sense).\nThis \\(V\\) is a matrix with number of rows equal to the total number of features in \\(\\mathcal{G}\\), and the number of columns equal to the latent dimension. We can subset the rows specific to the \\(k\\)-th omic to get the matrix (with less rows) \\(V^{(k)}\\).\n\nAutoencoder for Cell Embeddings: Each omics layer \\(k\\) has its own autoencoder that generates cell embeddings \\(U\\) from observed data \\(X^{(k)}\\):\n\n\\[\np_{\\text{decoder }k}(x^{(k)}_i | u_i, V^{(k)}) = \\text{NB}(x^{(k)}_i; \\text{mean vector}, \\text{dispersion vector}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{NB}\\) is a negative binomial distribution for modeling count data. Here, \\(U\\) is the “common” embedding across any of the \\(K\\) omics. (I’m using the notation \\(x^{(k)}_i\\) to denote the the \\(i\\)th cell in the \\(k\\)-th omic, which is a row in \\(X^{(k)}\\) – I apologize for this confusion notation, there’s a lot of things flying around.) Importantly, this “decoder” takes in the cell embedding \\(U\\) and the latent embeddings for all the features for the \\(k\\)-th omic, \\(V^{(k)}\\). This is accompanied by a encoder for each omic to yield its posterior Gaussian distribution,\n\\[\nq_{\\text{encoder }k}(u_i | x^{(k)}_i) = \\text{N}(\\text{some mean}, \\text{some covariance}).\n\\]\nWe’ll also need to train all \\(K\\) encoders and “decoders”.\nThe important formula to see how this works is the Equation (9) in the paper, which, in the notation in the notes here, would be,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&  \\big\\{\\text{The imputed expected expression of feature $j$ in omic $k$}\\big\\} = \\big\\{\\text{The $j$-th coordiate of: }\\\\\n& \\text{SoftMax}\\Big(\\alpha \\odot (V^{(k)})^\\top u_i+ \\beta \\Big)\\big\\} \\cdot \\big\\{\\text{Observed library size of the cell in omic $k$}\\big\\}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\odot\\) denotes the Hadamard product4, (i.e., entry-wise product). Note: 1) \\(V^{(k)}\\) is a matrix that has rows equal to the number of features in the \\(k\\)-th omic, and columns equal to the latent dimension. \\(u_i\\) is a vector of length equal to the number of latent dimensions. Therefore, \\((V^{(k)})^\\top u_i\\) is a vector of length equal to the number of features in the \\(k\\)-th omic. 2) This isn’t the decoder you might be familiar with hidden layers of linear transformations followed by activation functions. Instead, this is more-or-less a straightforward linear transformation that takes the feature embeddings and cell embeddings5.\n\nAdversarial Alignment: A discriminator \\(D\\) is trained to classify omics layers based on cell embeddings \\(u\\). Encoders are updated to fool the discriminator, aligning embeddings across modalities:\n\n\\[\n    - \\sum_k \\mathbb{E}_{X^{(K)}} \\left[ \\log D_k(\\text{discriminator}(U)) \\right],\n\\]\nwhere \\(D_k\\) is the the multiclass classification cross entropy, and the discriminator is a function that is being adversarially trained to try to distinguish between the \\(K\\) omics. The data encoders can then be trained in the opposite direction to fool the discriminator, ultimately leading to the alignment of cell embeddings from different omics layers.\n\nOverall Objective: The total loss combines data reconstruction, graph reconstruction, and adversarial alignment. That is, the discriminator is training to minimize\n\nError when predicting which omic the input data came from based on the embedding \\(U\\), while, simultaneously, the encoders and decoders are trying to maximize\n\\[\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    &\\lambda_{\\mathcal{G}} \\cdot \\text{Log-likelihood of generating graph $\\mathcal{G}$ based on feature embedding }V +\\\\\n    &\\lambda_{D} \\cdot \\text{The confusion of discriminator $D$ predicting the omic based on }U +\\\\\n    &\\Big[\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\text{Log-likelihood of generating data from omic $k$ based on } U \\text{ and }V\\Big],\n    \\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda_{\\mathcal{G}}\\) and \\(\\lambda_{D}\\) are hyperparameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.28: From Z.-J. Cao and Gao (2022).\n\n\n\n\nConceptually: 1) The adversarial discriminatory is working “against” you, and trying to predict if a cell’s embedding comes from one omic or the other. The better the adversary can do this, the more it means that you (GLUE) did not yet properly align the two omics. 2) The guidance graph is (at a high level) about orienting this alignment. As opposed to unsupervised integration methods that purely rely on geometric relations, GLUE uses this guidance graph to help determine, “If there are multiple ‘rotations’ of the omics to align them, which particular ‘rotation’ makes the most sense?”\nA brief note on other approaches.\nThere are fewer methods in this category, and these methods are a lot harder for a third-party to benchmark since they heavily rely on the biological information you’re using. However, for some examples, integrating single-cell RNA and proteins, you can look at B. Zhu et al. (2021), S. Chen et al. (2024). For single-cell RNA and ATAC, you can look at Z. Zhang, Yang, and Zhang (2022) in addition to GLUE.\n\n\n6.6.3 Don’t forget about all the usual multi-modal integration methods!\nDon’t forget that, similar to how there’s a TotalVI for CITE-seq data, there are a lot of vertical integration methods for RNA-ATAC multiome data. See the end of ?sec-union_totalvi for some benchmarking papers. I’ve seen a couple more often than others: WNN Hao et al. (2021) and MultiVI Ashuach et al. (2023) (see Figure 6.29, a deep-learning method).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.29: From Ashuach et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n\nTranslation between omics.\nA related task in paired multiome data is: given the RNA profile, can we use translate this into the ATAC profile, and vice versa? At a high level, this is not too different from using an integration of paired multiome data. You simply use one omic’s encoder, and then another omic’s decoder. There are some important engineering differences to facilitate this idea. You can see Polarbear (R. Zhang et al. (2022), see Figure 6.30) and BABEL Wu et al. (2021) for examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.30: From R. Zhang et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\nReturning back to the idea of “union” or “intersection” of information in ?rem-union-intersection, the ability to translate from one omic to another necessarily means you are conceptually more focused on learning the “intersection” of information.\nMosaic integration.\nWhat if you have many omics across many datasets, and some of your datasets are paired? We usually call this mosaic integration, where we essentially are “putting the mosaic together” using puzzle pieces of different datasets. In this task, we often have some mixture of paired multiome datasets and some single-omic datasets. See Figure 6.31 for an example. Two methods to look at as an example of this are scMoMaT Z. Zhang et al. (2023) and Cobalt Gong, Zhou, and Purdom (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.31: From Z. Zhang et al. (2023).",

They play a crucial role in controlling cellular identity, development, and response to environmental signals. TFs recognize distinct motifs, short DNA sequence patterns, and their binding can be influenced by chromatin accessibility, co-factors, and post-translational modifications. Some TFs act as pioneer factors, capable of binding to condensed chromatin and initiating the process of opening DNA for transcriptional activation. By integrating chromatin accessibility data with known TF motifs, methods like ChromVAR can infer which TFs are actively shaping regulatory landscapes in different cell states.\nThis TFs will play a big role in the next section, when we start discussing gene regulatory networks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.32: (Top): From Leiz et al.

    "text": "6.8 Gene regulatory networks (GRN)\nGene regulatory networks (GRNs) describe the intricate interactions between genes, transcription factors, enhancers, and other regulatory elements that control gene expression. Understanding these networks is critical for deciphering how normal cellular functions are maintained and how dysregulation leads to disease. In the context of single-cell and multi-omics data, GRNs provide a framework for linking chromatin accessibility, transcription factor activity, and gene expression dynamics to uncover the molecular basis of health and disease. See Figure 6.33 for the overarching theme of GRNs, where you might start building a GRN via a simple gene co-expression analysis (i.e., “connecting” genes that are correlated), but then later start leveraging biological insights (i.e., which genes are transcription factors, and where TFs bind to accessible chromatin regions, etc.) in later steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.33: From Badia-i-Mompel et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n(Note about this section: We’re going to use the words “enhancer,” “cis-regulatory element” (CREs), and “peak” interchangeably.)\n\n6.8.1 First: How we understand the elements that control a gene?\nA gene’s expression is governed by multiple regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, and transcription factors. Promoters serve as the binding sites for RNA polymerase and general transcription factors, initiating transcription. Enhancers, often located far from the gene they regulate, recruit transcription factors and co-activators to increase transcriptional output.\nTypically, a GRN falls into two types: 1) how do TFs bind to certain enhancer regions that cause a change in the downstream gene’s expression, or 2) how do enhancer regions themselves open and close to regulate a downstream gene’s expression. (I know, this is about to get a bit wonky.)\nFigure 6.34 shows the overall schematic of how to link enhancers (i.e., a peak region, sometimes also called a cis-regulatory element, CRE) to its target gene. See Figure 6.35 for how results for linked-peaks is often reported, where the “height” of the arc is the p-value about testing if a peak is linked to a particular gene. See https://stuartlab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_multiomic and https://www.archrproject.com/bookdown/peak2genelinkage-with-archr.html for examples of how to do this analysis in practice. You can also check out https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/features/2024-11-21-visualize-and-filter-multiome-atac-data for web portals for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.34: (Left): From Xie et al. (2023). (Right): From Leblanc and Lettre (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.35: (Left): From Adams et al. (2022).\n(Right): From Ma et al. (2020). (These types of plots usually focus on one particular element. When you see these plots, it’s not usually immediately obvious if the plots are showing if: 1) a gene is being regulated by many CREs, or if 2) a CRE regulates many genes.)\n\n\n\n\nTF footprints.\nTF footprinting is a computational approach used to infer transcription factor (TF) binding at specific genomic loci by analyzing patterns of chromatin accessibility at single-nucleotide resolution, often using ATAC-seq or DNase-seq data, see Figure 6.36. Unlike ChromVAR, which assesses motif activity by quantifying motif accessibility variation across cells or conditions, footprinting explicitly identifies regions where TFs are bound by detecting protected sites flanked by regions of high accessibility. This provides direct evidence of TF occupancy, distinguishing between motif presence and actual binding, thereby refining motif enrichment results from ChromVAR and uncovering context-specific regulatory interactions. See https://www.archrproject.com/bookdown/footprinting-with-archr.html and https://stuartlab.org/signac/1.2.0/articles/footprint for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.36: (Left) From Siersbæk et al. (2014).\n(Right) From https://www.archrproject.com/bookdown/footprinting-with-archr.html.\n\n\n\n\nA conceptual way to understand our goal.\nWhat we are hoping to do is to, essentially, learn the relations peaks and genes across all the peaks and genes. By doing this, we can piece together a graph, which becomes our GRN. See Figure 6.37.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.37: From D. Kim et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in GRNs (which is popular topic for more statistical/computation-leaning students), be aware that there are almost an endless list of GRN methods, see Figure 6.38. As we will discuss in Section 6.10, it is a nontrivial research question to even know “which method works the best.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.38: From Loers and Vermeirssen (2024). This is the list for methods at the time of the authors’ writing for multi-omic GRNs. If you include the methods that were designed for solely scRNA-seq, the list becomes unbelievably long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.2 GRNs between genes and TFs\nTranscription factors serve as key regulators in GRNs by binding to DNA motifs and either activating or repressing gene expression. The strength and specificity of TF-gene interactions are influenced by chromatin accessibility, cooperative binding with other TFs, and post-translational modifications. The advantage of using GRNs that only model TFs and their target genes (which could involve other TFs) is that the graph is much more manageable to think about. Here, the peaks (measuring regions of chromatin accessibility) allow you to determine: 1) how a TF might bind a peak, and 2) how that peak might influence a gene. All the peaks nearby a gene get “merged” in the modeling as one element altogether.\nA typical choice: Pando.\nPando Fleck et al. (2023) infers GRNs by modeling the relationship between gene expression, transcription factor (TF) activity, and chromatin accessibility using a regression-based framework. See Figure 6.39.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.39: From Fleck et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nInput/Output. The inputs to Pando are: 1) a paired multiome dataset for \\(n\\) cells, containing both RNA and ATAC features, and 2) a database of TFs and their motifs.\nThe primary output is a directed and weighted graph among genes (of which some genes are transcription factors).\n\nThe inference procedure follows these steps:6\n\nCandidate Regulatory Regions:\nPando identifies candidate regulatory regions by linking chromatin peaks to nearby genes using either the Signac or GREAT McLean et al. (2010) method. It considers a defined upstream and downstream distance relative to the gene’s transcription start site (TSS) or gene body. This gives a potential set of peaks for each gene.\nTF-Peak Associations:\nIt selects peaks that overlap TF binding motifs and computes correlations between peak accessibility and target gene expression. A threshold is applied to filter TF-gene and peak-gene pairs based on correlation strength. This filters down the list of possible peaks that might facilitate an interaction between a TF and its regulated gene.\nRegression Model:\nPando fits a regression model for each target gene \\(g_i\\), estimating the relationship between gene expression and TF activity at its regulatory regions. The general model is: \\[\ng_i \\approx \\sum_{j} \\beta_j (TF_j \\circ P_j)\n\\tag{6.1}\\] where \\(TF_j\\) is the expression of transcription factor \\(j\\) (i.e., this is another gene’s expression, but this particular gene is deemed a transcription factor based on a database), \\(P_j\\) is the accessibility of the associated peaks, \\(\\circ\\) represents an interaction term (which can be additive, multiplicative, or both), and \\(\\beta_j\\) denotes the inferred regulatory coefficient. By default, Pando fits a linear regression (i.e., generalized linear model for the Gaussian family), where the all the involved data (i.e., gene expression, transcription factor, etc.) has been already log-normalized.\n(Yes – this is as straightforward statistically as it gets. More on this later in Section 6.10.)\nStatistical Filtering and Adjustment:\nPando applies a multiple-testing correction (e.g., false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment) to the estimated coefficients from the linear regression and removes insignificant regulatory interactions. The resulting network consists of target genes, TF regulators, and their associated regulatory elements, allowing for further functional analyses.\n\nSee Figure 6.40 for an example of the resulting graph (subsetted to a particular TF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.40: From Fleck et al. (2023). This is the sub-network focusing on the TF GLI3 and all its downstream TFs (other named genes) and other genes (in gray circles).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.3 GRNs between genes, enhancers, and TFs\nIf you want “higher resolution” and want to model the specific interactions between particular peaks and their intermediary role between the TF and gene, you might instead want to use a GRN that models the interactions between all 3 elements – TFs, the peaks, and the target genes. (Recall, even though you might only be modeling the 2000 highly variable genes with many a couple hundred TFs, you have on the order of 300,000 peaks. So these graphs are incomprehensibly large, to the point you need to think carefully about why you want to learn such a large graph in the first place.)\nA typical choice: SCENIC+.\nSCENIC+ Bravo González-Blas et al. (2023) infers enhancer-driven gene regulatory networks (eGRNs) by integrating transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression data. See the workflow in Figure 6.41.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.41: From Bravo González-Blas et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nInput/Output. The inputs to SCENIC+ are: 1) a paired multiome dataset for \\(n\\) cells, containing both RNA and ATAC features, and 2) a database of TFs and their motifs.\nThe primary output is a directed and weighted graph among enhancer regions and genes (of which some genes are transcription factors).\n\nThe inference process follows these steps:\n\nIdentification of Candidate Enhancers:\nSCENIC+ processes single-cell chromatin accessibility data (scATAC-seq) using pycisTopic, which identifies differentially accessible regions (DARs) and groups co-accessible regions into enhancer candidates. These candidate enhancers are expected to contain key transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs).\nMotif Enrichment Analysis:\nSCENIC+ uses a large curated database of over 30,000 TF motifs, implemented in pycisTarget, to identify significant motif enrichments within enhancer regions. Two motif enrichment methods are employed:\n\ncisTarget: A ranking-based approach that scores each genomic region based on motif presence and selects the most significantly enriched motifs.\n\nDifferential Enrichment of Motifs (DEM): A statistical Wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify differentially enriched motifs across enhancer sets.\n\nTF-Enhancer-Gene Association:\nThe next step links candidate enhancers to their target genes using correlation-based methods. A gradient-boosting regression model (GRNBoost2, Moerman et al. (2019)) is applied to quantify the importance of both TFs and enhancer candidates for each target gene. The model assigns importance scores to enhancer–gene pairs, refining direct regulatory interactions.\neRegulon Construction:\nFalse discovery rate (FDR) correction is used to filter spurious TF-enhancer-gene associations. The final GRN consists of enhancer-driven regulons (eRegulons), where each TF is linked to a set of enhancer regions and target genes. The regulatory directionality (activation/repression) is inferred using correlation measures.\n\nSee Figure 6.42 for an example of the resulting graph (subsetted to a particular TF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.42: From Bravo González-Blas et al. (2023). This is the sub-network focusing particular TFs (all named in larger text), as well as the CREs (in diamonds) and other target genes (in circles, named with smaller text.)\n\n\n\n\nA brief note about other methods.\nMost GRNs fall in this category nowadays. You can see LINGER (see Figure 6.43), which basically follows the same logic as in SCENIC+ but instead uses a deep-learning approach to predict relations between TFs and enhancers on target genes, as one of many examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.43: From Yuan and Duren (2024).",

    "text": "6.9 So… what do you do with the GRN?\n\nGenerative modeling of cell types/states (Computational):\nIn some sense, a GRN is a very fancy “correlation matrix” of sorts. This means if you had the GRN, you could hypothetically label cells better since you could: 1) see the cell’s gene expression profile, and 2) know beforehand the “correlation” between genes. With these two ingredients, you could calculate a better “likelihood” a given cell corresponds to the cell type/state of this particular GRN.\nEncoding longitudinal information about the cascading effect of perturbations (Computational, Biological):\nSince the gene network, in principle, encapsulates how events unfold in a cell, it (in some sense) contains longitudinal information. We typically call this a “cascade” (i.e., how changes in one genomic regions affect other genomic regions over time). See Ng et al. (2021). This is one of the main reasons people study GRNs. For instance, Fleck et al. (2023) subset the overall GRN to learn how the GRN changes during brain development. Bravo González-Blas et al. (2023) shows how using the GRN can improve upon our understanding of fate commitment during differentiation. L. Wang et al. (2023) explicitly models how time affects the GRN via an ordinary differential equation model (ODE). These are just to name a few methods that explicitly are thinking about how our learning of the GRN helps us better understand time dynamics.\nPotential therapeutic targets (Biological):\nIf you knew how the genomic cascade works, then hypothetically, you have roadmap on which genomic region to edit. This is basically the start of the motivation of CRISPR knockouts – if I knew how a particular transcription factor influences many downstream genes, then if I silence or knock out the particular gene producing that TF, then I could manipulate a lot of the transcriptomic activity (and allegedly, a lot of proteomics and biological processes). So the GRN gives me a roadmap on which TF might be a good candidate to knock out in order to prevent any deleterious pathways from activating.\nUnderstanding the functional impact of SNPs in non-coding regions (Computational, Biological):\nThis will be a much bigger theme when we discuss SNPs in the next chapter, Section 7.1. Most of our SNPs are in non-coding regions, and we know that many of these SNPs have some potential effect on a disease from GWAS studies. However, it’s hard to know why these SNPs have a regulatory effect. By learning a GRN, we learn how different enhancer regions affect genes, so we might suspect that if a particular genetic variation lies in that enhancer region, the role of that SNP might be to impact that regulatory effect. (Technically, you need to do a massively parallelized report assay (MPRA, a different wetlab experiment) to actually demonstrate that the SNP actually impacts regulation. We’ll discuss this more later in Section 7.1.)\nCellular memory (Biological):\nThere is a long history of trying to understand if GRNs contribute to the “memory” of a cell. After all, you might ask about: if I stimulate a cell, if a cell is infected by a pathogen, etc., after this event subsides, does the cell “remember” what it just went through? There is no “brain” for the cell, so either you think: 1) cells are Markovian in some sense – they no memory of how it interacted with its environment, or 2) there is some long-term way for cells to alter something about itself to contribute to “memory.” This gets pretty fascinating biologically pretty quick. How would a cell even store memory? It’s likely not through the DNA is you don’t expect cells to naturally acquire many mutations in the DNA over time (hold that thought when we discuss ?sec-dna_structural_variation). It’s likely not through the mRNA or proteins since both degrade, either on the time-scale of hours Y. Wang et al. (2002) or a couple days Rusilowicz-Jones, Urbé, and Clague (2022), respectively. Then, we turn to possibly something epigenetic. After all, DNA methylation can be inherited from one generation to another (not just on the cell level, but also on the organism level) Y. Zhang and Sirard (2021). So it is possible that GRNs (not quite about DNA methylation, but still epigenetic in flavor) are also stable enough (without extreme external stimuli) that they hold information about a cell’s memory? This is the premise of a lot of basic biology interest in GRNs, see Almeida et al. (2021) for example. For instance, there is preliminary evidence that stress changes the GRN of certain brain cells Ziegler et al. (2022). See Cha and Lee (2020) for a review of GRN in relation to diseases, or a focus on Alzheimer’s disease Gupta et al. (2022).\n\nBrief note about transcriptomic bursting.\nGene expression is inherently stochastic, occurring in bursts rather than as a continuous process, due to the random activation and inactivation of transcriptional machinery. This transcriptomic bursting means that the expression levels of individual genes fluctuate over time, making it unreliable to infer stable co-expression patterns from a single time point, see Figure 6.44. Instead of focusing on transient expression snapshots, studying gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provides a more robust framework for understanding gene interactions over longer timescales. GRNs capture how transcription factors (TFs) regulate target genes by binding to enhancer regions, establishing regulatory relationships that persist beyond momentary transcriptional fluctuations. By analyzing GRNs, researchers can infer the underlying structure of transcriptional control, allowing for a deeper understanding of cellular processes that remain stable despite the randomness. See Tang et al. (2023) for an overview of modeling transcriptomic bursting from single-cell data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.44: (Top) From Q. Zhang et al. (2024). (The figure shows that on average, transcription starts and stops on the time-scale of hours in humans.)\n(Bottom) From Jiang, Zhang, and Li (2017).",

    "text": "6.10 What makes the field of GRN crazy?\n\nNOTE: Everything in this section is Kevin’s extremely opinionated opinions.\n\nThere’s a lot of side notes I need to make about GRNs, since a lot of students become interested in GRNs from many different angles. First off, a couple notes about how I think about GRNs:\n\nDirection of causality is dictated by biology:\nPart of the reason a lot of GRNs can “get away” with such simple statistics is that the directionality of edges is dictated by biology, not math. After all, we have a pretty reasonable understanding that TFs need to bind to certain regions to modulate a gene’s expression.\nKeeping in mind the time-scale of cells used when learning the GRN:\nWhich cells did you use to train the GRN? Did you use cells of many different cell types/states, or many different stages of progression? If so, then your GRN might be capturing any possible interaction between TFs and genes, and not be specific to a particular cellular state. This is to say – you need to think hard about what your GRN represents in terms of time. Does your GRN represent something more instantaneous (i.e., specific to a cell or a meta-cell), and you think the GRN itself is changing as the cells change? Or does your GRN represent any possible interaction between any TF or any gene, but if you were given a particular cell, you can’t quite determine if the specific TF is regulating a specific gene at that moment?\nSidenote 1: Even if you wanted to interpret your GRN with no time context, you’ll be in trouble. First, you need variation in your data to learn GRNs. (If all your cells literally had the same expression in RNA and ATAC, you would no ability to learn the GRN.) So you must have some variation among your cells. So the real question is: is that variation due to some underlying biological dynamics?\nSidenote 2: This means you should be aware of Simpson’s paradox7 when working with GRNs. See J. J. Li et al. (2024) for a cell-biology specific example of Simpon’s paradox.\n\nAs a sidenote, it is important that different methods assume (by default) a different distance between a peak and its regulated gene, see Figure 6.45. Also note that this distance isn’t even necessarily distance (since often, you might expect more enhancers to be upstream of a gene’s TSS than downstream). Also, the way different methods “weigh” the total regulatory effect of all the CREs on a gene might differ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.45: From Loers and Vermeirssen (2024)\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we (as a field) focus on “causal” edges, instead of simply “correlation” edges?\nA lot of the methods I noted are placing edges between 2 elements simply based on correlation. If you are statistics-leaning student, this might leave a bad taste in your mouth since either: 1) you are aware of the differences between correlation and conditional independence, and/or 2) you are aware of the differences between correlation and causation (say, in the counterfactual sense).\nAs for conditional independence, methods to learn gene regulatory networks via conditional independence have fallen out of favor, not because the statistical goal is not worthwhile, but (in my impression), the scientific improvement in our biological understanding hasn’t been substantially large enough to warrant such a massively more complicated estimation procedure. (If you can figure out a way to convincingly articulate that conditional independence networks starkly gives you a more accurate picture of biology, there is a lot of reward. However, to do this, you need to have a very rigorous biological understand on how you’ll do this, likely with a lot of wetlab experiments to back you up.\nAs for causality, an ideal goal might be to only place edges if perturbing one element necessarily causes a change in the downstream element. We will return back to this when we discuss CRISPR knockouts in ?sec-chapter_7. However, suffice to say, for now, this is extremely challenging for many aspects:\n\nLimitations of data collection:\nUnlike a clinical trial, in single-cell biology, we are measuring everything at once, and we kill the cell to sequence the cell. This means: 1) we cannot accurately be sure about the direction of causality, since we need to estimate the “age” of a cell and the “timeline” of a cell. (After all, a foundation of causal inference is that you can say definitely someone got a treatment before you measure the outcome.) In our cell biology setting, you are measuring all the peaks and gene expression at the same time, so how can you be so definitive on the direction of causality?\nEven if you retort and set up a longitudinal CRISPR experiment, since you have to kill (lyse) the cell to sequence it, you can only get longitudinal information about the overall petri dish, not longitudinal information about specific cells. (Technically, this aspect isn’t the worst limitation. After all, in an observational study, if you analyze enough people, you can know if a drug caused a change in someone’s blood pressure even if you didn’t measure someone’s blood pressure before they took the drug. However, in our single-cell context, since we can never observe both pre-treatment and post-treatment, it is hard to stratify the “treatment effect” of a CRISPR knockout, unless you’re working with a mostly homogeneous cell line where there’s basically no variation among the cells.\nAre we really learning causal effects if we don’t know all the middle-men in transcription?\nEven if you say that a particular TF “causes” a change in downstream gene’s expression, does this really make sense unless you are honing in on the specific pathway and mechanisms? After all, the grand holy grail of cell biology is to articulate the specific set of events. If your hard work of causal inference is only amounts to stating two things are causally related, but you are not able to say explicitly how (in a bio-mechanistic sense), is your finding advancing biology, or is it just a slight improvement in the statistics?\nSee Figure 6.46 for an example of the type of mechanisms a cell biologists wants to uncover at the end of the day. It’s a very literal sequence of events of how certain biological processes unfold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.46: From Taylor, Cullen, and Martin (2008)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is exactly is the “treatment”?\nThis is more of a philosophical aspect – if you do not have a way to actually perturb a biological element (i.e., we do not have the technology to actually safely alter a particular cell element), is it even that important to learn the true causality? For instance, if I tell you that learning how to fly will definitely cause you to live past 100 years, would you really be that interested in my finding?\nDo CRISPR knockouts actually recapitulate what naturally happens?\nThe most common way to validate a GRN is to perform a CRISPR knockout and measure what happens to the resulting cells. (We’ll discuss this more in ?sec-chapter_7.) This is great to validate a computational method’s GRN. However, it doesn’t necessarily recapitulate what happens naturally in the body during differentiation or a disease’s progression. For example, if I gave you a drug that cured cancer but caused you to turn into a vampire, would this be a viable discovery?\n\n\nSo what does this mean for me?\nDespite this shortcomings of existing GRNs, technological limitations have never stopped ambitious researchers to find creative solutions. When you work on GRNs, the biggest question is to have a research plan on how to validate your GRN (nowadays, it’s typically done with a CRISPR knockout experiment, but it can also involve some computational validation) and what you are planning to demonstrate its importance downstream for new biological insights.\n\nA brief note on related topics.\nSee Loers and Vermeirssen (2024) and D. Kim et al. (2023) for fantastic overviews on GRNs learned from multi-omic data. Remember that GRNs have existed way before paired multiome data has been around. See Karamveer and Uzun (2024), Stock et al. (2024) for overviews not specific to learning GRNs from multi-omic data. See Garbulowski et al. (2024), Cannoodt et al. (2021), Pratapa et al. (2020) for an example of how to synthetically generate a gene regulatory network and the corresponding scRNA-seq data (to benchmark methods).\nAlso, note that there are some network methods that have nodes for each genomic feature and cells, see Figure 6.47.
