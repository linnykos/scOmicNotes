    "section": "3.1 What are “omics”?",
    "text": "3.1 What are “omics”?\nThe term “omics” refers to a broad field of biology aimed at the comprehensive characterisation and quantification of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism. At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more. Each of these fields leverages high-throughput technologies to generate massive datasets that capture complex interactions within cells, tissues, or organisms.\nThe rise of “omics” has revolutionised biology by enabling researchers to ask holistic questions such as how different genes, proteins, or metabolites interact in health and disease. It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies. In public health, “omics” provides tools to bridge molecular discoveries with population-level outcomes, offering new opportunities to tackle complex health challenges.\n\n3.1.1 Some examples of a “cell-biology” question\n\nHow the brain develops (i.e. the longitudinal sequence of events between birth and maturation), shown in Figure 3.1.\n\nHow microglia in the brain gain or lose certain functions during ageing, shown in Figure 3.2.\n\nWhy certain cells (i.e. cancer cells) divide uncontrollably, see Figure 3.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: What is the sequence of cell types that emerge (and where) during human brain development?

    "text": "3.2 How “omics” comes into the picture\nTo answer cell-biology questions we leverage different omics to learn clues about\n1. the cellular functions of a biological system, and\n2. how those functions change during disease, ageing, etc.\nAll these omics are related:\n\nThe central dogma of biology (DNA → RNA → protein) is illustrated in Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5, linking the three most fundamental omics.\n\nThe epigenome, shown in Figure 3.6, comprises chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins that regulate gene expression yet are not part of the DNA itself. The figure highlights three commonly studied features: DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and histone modifications.\n\nThese layers are summarised in Figure 3.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Central dogma. (Source: https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/translation/a/intro-to-gene-expression-central-dogma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Central dogma.

(Wen et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: Biology is constantly revising the details).\nStatistical knowledge is rarely revised—mostly refined. We know properties that generalize to much broader settings (i.e., less statistical assumptions) and much more refined statistical rates for the settings studied two decades ago. (1) There’s little revisions, since once someone proves a statistical theorem, it is very unlikely for it to get disproven in the future. (2) Statistics generally focuses on what happens in an ``average/typical’’ scenario.\nBiology, in comparison, has many revisions and refinements. There’s a couple reasons for this: (1) Biology research is driven by technology. Hence, as we can image/sequence/profile new aspects of a cell, design new model organisms, or collect more data, we might revise a lot of understanding of how cells work. (2) While there are broad biological mechanisms that generally hold true, many diseases occur when the general biological principle no longer holds true. For this reasons, a lot of cell biology research is about these exceptions, which cause us to question how universally true a biological mechanism is. (As a simple example – we’re taught humans have 46 chromosomes. However, many conditions such as Down Syndrome, originate from having an abnormal number of chromosomes.)\n\n\nRemark (All the omics we will study in this course are matrices).\nOne of major missions of this course is to answer the following question: Every omic is represented as a matrix (generally, where the rows are cells, and columns are certain features, depending on the omic). In that case, how come some statistical methods designed for one omic isn’t applicable for another omic?\nWhile there are certain statistical answers to this question, most of the answers are based on biology. Certain methods rely on a specific biological premise, and that premise becomes hard to justify as you switch from one omic to another.\nThis is not too dissimilar from a causal analysis. In a causal analysis, the reason certain features get labeled as a confounder, treatment, outcome, instrumental variable, mediator, etc. relies on the context.\n\n\n\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

    "section": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?",
    "text": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?\n\n2.2.1 Basic biology\nSingle-cell data offer a transformative lens to study the fundamental processes of life at unparalleled resolution. Unlike bulk data, which averages signals across populations of cells, single-cell technologies allow researchers to examine the diversity and complexity of individual cells within a tissue or organism. This level of detail provides insights into key biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation during development, the plasticity of cell states in response to environmental cues, and the organization of complex tissues. For instance, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered new cell types in the brain and immune system, challenging traditional classifications and offering a more nuanced understanding of cellular identities and functions. These insights are essential for constructing more accurate models of how life operates at a cellular level.\nMany of the examples shown in Figs. Figure 2.1–Figure 2.2 are basic biology questions. Two additional examples are shown in Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: How do cancer cells survive successive therapies? (Schaff et al. 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: What deteriorates in a cell as it ages (Silva and Schumacher 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Benchside-to-bedside applications\nSingle-cell data have enormous potential to revolutionize clinical practice by bridging molecular biology and medicine. After learning basic biology, the next stage is to use our newfound understanding to advance treatments. (We typically call this translation research, to denote translating our basic biology knowledge to therapeutic improvements.) This is also called benchside (for the wet-bench, i.e. laboratory setting) to bedside (for the hospital setting).\nBy mapping cellular heterogeneity in diseased and healthy tissues, researchers can identify specific cell populations driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. For example, in cancer, single-cell analyses have uncovered rare tumor subclones that evade treatment, providing critical targets for drug development. Similarly, in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, single-cell profiling of synovial tissues has identified inflammatory cell states that correlate with disease severity and treatment response. Beyond diagnostics, this technology enables precision medicine by tailoring treatments to the molecular profiles of individual patients. As single-cell approaches continue to evolve, they are poised to refine drug-discovery pipelines, improve vaccine design, and ultimately transform how diseases are diagnosed and treated.\nThere are a few ways this typically happens. Figure 2.10 shows one example, where single-cell research helps identify the specific cell types and specific edits needed to improve cellular function. Figure 2.11 shows another example, where understanding the cellular functions, we can improve how conventional methods can be used to measure more accurate biomarkers. Cancer research has been (by far) the biggest beneficiary of single-cell research, and Figure 2.12 illustrates how single-cell improves cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: There are current single-cell therapies that involve extracting blood from a donor, altering the cells outside the body, and then infusing the altered blood back into the donor. (Source: https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/crispr-cancer-research-treatment)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: After learning the causal mechanisms for specific cell types for Alzheimer’s disease that can be detected from blood draws, we can refine existing biomarkers to monitor Alzheimer’s. (Hansson et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Example of how insights from single-cell studies transform cancer therapies. (Gohil et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 What existed prior to single-cell data?\nWestern blots and flow cytometry.\nBefore the advent of single-cell technologies, biological research relied heavily on methods like western blots and flow cytometry to study cells and molecules. Western blotting (shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14), developed in the late 1970 s, enabled researchers to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample, providing insights into cellular pathways and protein-expression levels. However, this technique required lysing entire tissues or cell populations, averaging the signals from thousands or millions of cells. Flow cytometry (shown in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16), emerging in the 1980s, represented a major step forward by allowing researchers to analyse individual cells’ physical and chemical characteristics in suspension. While flow cytometry offered single-cell resolution, it was limited to analysing predefined markers and could not capture the full complexity of cellular states or gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Illustration of the Western-blot technique. (Source: https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/western-blotting-electrophoresis-techniques)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Example Western-blot data. (Kepchia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Illustration of flow-cytometry technique. (Source: https://www.streck.com/blog/principles-of-flow-cytometry/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Example flow-cytometry data. (Verschoor et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\nMicroarray technology.\nThe 1990s marked the rise of microarray technology (shown in Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18), which allowed scientists to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Microarrays revolutionised transcriptomics by enabling high-throughput studies of gene activity in various conditions, tissues, and diseases. Despite its transformative impact, microarray analysis was fundamentally a bulk method, averaging signals across all cells in a sample. It is also based on light intensity, which can be tricky to extract consistently. These limitations obscured cellular heterogeneity, especially in complex tissues where distinct cell types or states contribute uniquely to biological processes or disease mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Illustration of microarray technique. (Source: https://www.onlinebiologynotes.com/dna-microarray-principle-types-and-steps-involved-in-cdna-microarrays/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Example microarray image prior to quantification. (Source: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat555/node/28/)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: the close history between microarrays and high-dimensional statistics).\nHistorically, the rise of microarray data spurred advances in high-dimensional statistics — e.g. the Lasso (Tibshirani et al. 2005), gene-expression classification for leukaemia (Golub et al. 1999), and empirical-Bayes multiple testing (Efron and Tibshirani 2002).\n\nBulk sequencing technologies.\nIn the 2000s, bulk sequencing technologies for DNA and RNA emerged, further advancing the study of genomes and transcriptomes. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) became a powerful tool for capturing the entire transcriptome with greater accuracy and dynamic range than microarrays. Similarly, DNA sequencing enabled comprehensive studies of genetic variation, from point mutations to structural alterations. However, like microarrays, bulk sequencing aggregated signals across many cells, masking rare cell populations and the heterogeneity critical to understanding dynamic processes such as tumour evolution or immune responses. These bulk techniques laid the groundwork for single-cell methods by driving innovations in high-throughput sequencing and data analysis, which would later be adapted for single-cell resolution.",

    "text": "2.3 When did single-cell data become popular, and how has the technology advanced?\n\n2.3.1 The rise of single-cell data\nSingle-cell data began gaining prominence in the early 2010s, fuelled by advances in microfluidics and next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), pioneered around 2009 – 2011, was among the first methods to achieve widespread adoption. It enabled measurement of gene expression in individual cells, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk analyses masked. Early applications revealed new cell types and states, reshaped our understanding of development, and identified rare populations in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Popularity grew as throughput increased, costs fell, and workflows became standardised.\nFigure 2.19 and Figure 2.20 contrasts bulk and single-cell sequencing. Figure 2.21 shows how single-cell data tease apart different sources of heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: Illustrations of how single-cell sequencing improves resolution for studying cancer resistance.

Single-cell proteomics allows detailed analysis of protein expression and signalling pathways. Single-cell ATAC-seq profiles chromatin accessibility; Hi-C and related methods reveal 3D genome architecture. Spatial transcriptomics connects gene expression with tissue context. CRISPR-based single-cell screens enable high-throughput perturbations, and lineage-tracing barcodes add a temporal dimension, charting cell ancestry in development and disease. Together, these advances transformed single-cell biology into a multi-dimensional, integrative discipline.\nMany of these technologies appear in Figure 2.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Illustration (circa 2020) of technologies that pair various omics at single-cell resolution.

    "text": "2.4 What is the role of a biostatistician in a wet-lab / clinical world?\nCell biology is vast – especially for students trained primarily in statistics or biostatistics. Many disciplines intersect with cell biology. For example:\n\nStatistics / Biostatistics – statistical models for complex biological processes; translation between maths and biology\nComputational biology – scalable computation, leveraging public data\nBioinformatics / Genetics – tools that draw on large‐consortium resources\nEpidemiology – population-level data and policy recommendations\nBioengineering – new laboratory technologies for cheaper/faster measurement or imaging\nBiology – mechanistic studies in model organisms\nBiochemistry / Molecular biology – structure, function, interactions of specific molecules\nWet-bench medicine – disease mechanisms via tissues, models, cell lines\nClinical-facing medicine – patient treatment and real-world sample collection\nPharmacology – integrating evidence to design new drugs and therapies\n\nGiven so many players, what does a biostatistician contribute?\n\n2.4.1 How a biostatistician perceives the world\nGive me a concrete (ideally cleaned) dataset: the larger the better—and I will analyse it from many angles.\nCausality: A mathematically stricter notion than correlation, usually via (1) counterfactual reasoning, or (2) a directed-acyclic-graph picture of how variables relate.\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: statistical causality for cell biology is extremely difficult). Obstacles: (i) tracking the same cell over time is impossible because sequencing lyses it; (ii) longitudinal human tissue samples are rare. Strong modelling assumptions can help but must withstand biological scrutiny. The bottleneck is often data, not maths—ambitious statisticians who learn enough biology still have a fighting chance.\n\n\nRemark (Single-cell methods are largely an “associative” world): Most single-cell analyses discover mechanisms that are statistically correlational; the causal proof comes from experiments and biology.\n\nThe research inquiry starts and ends with a method: (How to integrate modalities? learn a gene-regulatory network? perform valid post-clustering tests?) Start with a statistical model and a parameter of interest \\(\\theta^*\\), then typically:\n\nDevelop a novel estimator of \\(\\theta^*\\), explaining why current methods fail (e.g. lack robustness, accuracy, power, or are heuristic). Focus on statistical logic: A clear, simple mathematical intuition should show the gap and how the new method fills it.\nProve theorems showing the estimate \\(\\hat\\theta\\) converges to \\(\\theta^*\\) under stated assumptions. Focus on consistency & convergence: More data should provably yield more accurate results (often the highlight of a statistics paper).\nSimulations demonstrating that when the true \\(\\theta^*\\) is known, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) beats competing estimators across many settings. Illustration via benchmarking: Empirically recover the correct answer more often than existing methods.\nReal-data demonstration showing results align with known biology or provide biologically sensible new insights. Focus on practicality: The method must work in real scenarios mirroring its target audience.\n\nMindset: deliver a reliable tool that others can trust as-is. Human validations are often impractical; guard-rails and diagnostics are vital.\nWhy biostatisticians need wet-lab biologists / clinicians: We rarely generate data ourselves, so collaborators supply (i) exciting data with novel questions, (ii) biological context for sensible assumptions, and (iii) experimental validation of statistical findings.\n\n\n2.4.2 How a wet-lab biologist / clinician perceives the world\nExperiments, experiments, experiments: Carefully controlled—even if small—to make downstream analysis straightforward.\nCausality comes from a chain of experiments. Suppose we study a gene’s role in disease:\n\nTemporal evidence, such as change in gene expression preceding a change in cell phenotype. A causal mechanism should occur before the phenotype.\nBiological logic providing explanation of the underlying mechanism (binding factors, protein function, evolutionary rationale, etc.). For example, there must be a coherent pathway from gene → protein → phenotype.\nUniversality of how the described association persists across cell lines or organisms. A causal mechanism should be discoverable in other systems (extent depends on how general the logic is). This is offten the highlight of a biology paper.\nValidation, such as knocking out the gene alters the outcome, whereas similar genes do not. For example, perturbing the specific gene (not its close counterparts) changes the outcome.\n\nInquiry starts and ends with a biological hypothesis: Large intellectual effort goes into proposing explanations and designing experiments to rule them in or out.\nMindset: Assemble overwhelming evidence for a mechanism, combining careful experiments and biological logic.\nWhy wet-lab scientists need biostatisticians: Data are now complex and plentiful; exhaustive experiments for every hypothesis are infeasible. Statistical methods can (i) account for data & biological complexity and (ii) prioritise hypotheses worth experimental investment.\n\nSo how does a biostatistician develop computational / statistical methods for cell biology?\n\n\nBiological context – What is the biological system and the “north-star” question? Which premises are accepted, which ones are to be tested, and why is it important to understand this mechanism better?\nTechnology, experiment, data – How are data collected and why did you choose this particular {technology, experiment, data} trio? What technical artefacts arise?\nBoundaries of current tools – Simple analyses first: what “breaks” in existing workflows? Is there preliminary evidence a new computational method would do better?\nStatistical model – What is the insight that a different computational method could interrogate the biology better? (Here the statistics training begins.)\nDevelop a method & show robustness – Robustness can be defined numerically (i.e., noise tolerance) or biologically (i.e., applicable across contexts/environments). Often, the biological question you study lacks a ground truth, so validity arguments lean on biological logic.\nUncover new / refined biology – Does the method advance our biological understanding? How confident are we that findings generalise beyond the original {technology, experiment, data} trio? (This is usually the crown-jewel of your computational biology paper – it’s not necessary your specific analyses, but the potential that your tool can be used on other biological studies beyond what you’ve demonstrated your method on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfron, Bradley, and Robert Tibshirani. 2002. “Empirical Bayes Methods and False Discovery Rates for Microarrays.” Genetic Epidemiology 23 (1): 70–86.\n\n\nGohil, Satyen H, J Bryan Iorgulescu, David A Braun, Derin B Keskin, and Kenneth J Livak. 2021. “Applying High-Dimensional Single-Cell Technologies to the Analysis of Cancer Immunotherapy.” Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology 18 (4): 244–56.\n\n\nGolub, Todd R, Donna K Slonim, Pablo Tamayo, Christine Huard, Michelle Gaasenbeek, Jill P Mesirov, Hilary Coller, et al. 1999. “Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring.” Science 286 (5439): 531–37.\n\n\nHansson, Oskar, Kaj Blennow, Henrik Zetterberg, and Jeffrey Dage. 2023. “Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in Clinical Practice and Trials.” Nature Aging 3 (5): 506–19.\n\n\nKepchia, Devin, Ling Huang, Richard Dargusch, Robert A Rissman, Maxim N Shokhirev, Wolfgang Fischer, and David Schubert. 2020. “Diverse Proteins Aggregate in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease Brain.” Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy 12: 1–20.\n\n\nLei, Yalan, Rong Tang, Jin Xu, Wei Wang, Bo Zhang, Jiang Liu, Xianjun Yu, and Si Shi. 2021. “Applications of Single-Cell Sequencing in Cancer Research: Progress and Perspectives.” Journal of Hematology & Oncology 14 (1): 91.\n\n\nSchaff, Dylan L, Aria J Fasse, Phoebe E White, Robert J Vander Velde, and Sydney M Shaffer. 2024. “Clonal Differences Underlie Variable Responses to Sequential and Prolonged Treatment.” Cell Systems 15 (3): 213–26.\n\n\nShalek, Alex K, and Mikael Benson. 2017. “Single-Cell Analyses to Tailor Treatments.” Science Translational Medicine 9 (408): eaan4730.\n\n\nSilva, Paulo FL da, and Björn Schumacher. 2021. “Principles of the Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Aging.” Journal of Investigative Dermatology 141 (4): 951–60.\n\n\nTeichmann, Sarah, and Mirjana Efremova. 2020. “Method of the Year 2019: Single-Cell Multimodal Omics.” Nature Methods 17 (1): 2020.\n\n\nTibshirani, Robert, Michael Saunders, Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, and Keith Knight. 2005. “Sparsity and Smoothness via the Fused Lasso.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology 67 (1): 91–108.\n\n\nVerschoor, Chris P, Alina Lelic, Jonathan L Bramson, and Dawn ME Bowdish. 2015. “An Introduction to Automated Flow Cytometry Gating Tools and Their Implementation.” Frontiers in Immunology 6: 380.\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more. Each of these fields leverages high-throughput technologies to generate massive datasets that capture complex interactions within cells, tissues, or organisms.\nThe rise of “omics” has revolutionised biology by enabling researchers to ask holistic questions such as how different genes, proteins, or metabolites interact in health and disease. It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies.

(2) While there are broad biological mechanisms that generally hold true, many diseases occur when the general biological principle no longer holds true. For this reasons, a lot of cell biology research is about these exceptions, which cause us to question how universally true a biological mechanism is.

Certain methods rely on a specific biological premise, and that premise becomes hard to justify as you switch from one omic to another.\nThis is not too dissimilar from a causal analysis.

    "section": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?",
    "text": "2.2 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?\n\n2.2.1 Basic biology\nSingle-cell data offer a transformative lens to study the fundamental processes of life at unparalleled resolution. Unlike bulk data, which averages signals across populations of cells, single-cell technologies allow researchers to examine the diversity and complexity of individual cells within a tissue or organism. This level of detail provides insights into key biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation during development, the plasticity of cell states in response to environmental cues, and the organization of complex tissues. For instance, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered new cell types in the brain and immune system, challenging traditional classifications and offering a more nuanced understanding of cellular identities and functions. These insights are essential for constructing more accurate models of how life operates at a cellular level.\nMany of the examples shown in Figs. Figure 2.1–Figure 2.2 are basic biology questions. Two additional examples are shown in Figure 2.8 and Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: How do cancer cells survive successive therapies? (Schaff et al. 2024)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: What deteriorates in a cell as it ages (Silva and Schumacher 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Benchside-to-bedside applications\nSingle-cell data have enormous potential to revolutionize clinical practice by bridging molecular biology and medicine. After learning basic biology, the next stage is to use our newfound understanding to advance treatments. (We typically call this translation research, to denote translating our basic biology knowledge to therapeutic improvements.) This is also called benchside (for the wet-bench, i.e. laboratory setting) to bedside (for the hospital setting).\nBy mapping cellular heterogeneity in diseased and healthy tissues, researchers can identify specific cell populations driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. For example, in cancer, single-cell analyses have uncovered rare tumor subclones that evade treatment, providing critical targets for drug development. Similarly, in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, single-cell profiling of synovial tissues has identified inflammatory cell states that correlate with disease severity and treatment response. Beyond diagnostics, this technology enables precision medicine by tailoring treatments to the molecular profiles of individual patients. As single-cell approaches continue to evolve, they are poised to refine drug-discovery pipelines, improve vaccine design, and ultimately transform how diseases are diagnosed and treated.\nThere are a few ways this typically happens. Figure 2.10 shows one example, where single-cell research helps identify the specific cell types and specific edits needed to improve cellular function. Figure 2.11 shows another example, where understanding the cellular functions, we can improve how conventional methods can be used to measure more accurate biomarkers. Cancer research has been (by far) the biggest beneficiary of single-cell research, and Figure 2.12 illustrates how single-cell improves cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: There are current single-cell therapies that involve extracting blood from a donor, altering the cells outside the body, and then infusing the altered blood back into the donor.

(Hansson et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Example of how insights from single-cell studies transform cancer therapies. (Gohil et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 What existed prior to single-cell data?\nWestern blots and flow cytometry.\nBefore the advent of single-cell technologies, biological research relied heavily on methods like western blots and flow cytometry to study cells and molecules. Western blotting (shown in Figure 2.13 and Figure 2.14), developed in the late 1970 s, enabled researchers to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample, providing insights into cellular pathways and protein-expression levels. However, this technique required lysing entire tissues or cell populations, averaging the signals from thousands or millions of cells. Flow cytometry (shown in Figure 2.15 and Figure 2.16), emerging in the 1980s, represented a major step forward by allowing researchers to analyse individual cells’ physical and chemical characteristics in suspension. While flow cytometry offered single-cell resolution, it was limited to analysing predefined markers and could not capture the full complexity of cellular states or gene expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.13: Illustration of the Western-blot technique. (Source: https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/western-blotting-electrophoresis-techniques)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.14: Example Western-blot data. (Kepchia et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.15: Illustration of flow-cytometry technique. (Source: https://www.streck.com/blog/principles-of-flow-cytometry/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.16: Example flow-cytometry data. (Verschoor et al. 2015)\n\n\n\n\nMicroarray technology.\nThe 1990s marked the rise of microarray technology (shown in Figure 2.17 and Figure 2.18), which allowed scientists to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. Microarrays revolutionised transcriptomics by enabling high-throughput studies of gene activity in various conditions, tissues, and diseases. Despite its transformative impact, microarray analysis was fundamentally a bulk method, averaging signals across all cells in a sample. It is also based on light intensity, which can be tricky to extract consistently. These limitations obscured cellular heterogeneity, especially in complex tissues where distinct cell types or states contribute uniquely to biological processes or disease mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.17: Illustration of microarray technique. (Source: https://www.onlinebiologynotes.com/dna-microarray-principle-types-and-steps-involved-in-cdna-microarrays/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.18: Example microarray image prior to quantification. (Source: https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat555/node/28/)\n\n\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: the close history between microarrays and high-dimensional statistics).\nHistorically, the rise of microarray data spurred advances in high-dimensional statistics — e.g. the Lasso (Tibshirani et al. 2005), gene-expression classification for leukaemia (Golub et al. 1999), and empirical-Bayes multiple testing (Efron and Tibshirani 2002).\n\nBulk sequencing technologies.\nIn the 2000s, bulk sequencing technologies for DNA and RNA emerged, further advancing the study of genomes and transcriptomes. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) became a powerful tool for capturing the entire transcriptome with greater accuracy and dynamic range than microarrays. Similarly, DNA sequencing enabled comprehensive studies of genetic variation, from point mutations to structural alterations. However, like microarrays, bulk sequencing aggregated signals across many cells, masking rare cell populations and the heterogeneity critical to understanding dynamic processes such as tumour evolution or immune responses. These bulk techniques laid the groundwork for single-cell methods by driving innovations in high-throughput sequencing and data analysis, which would later be adapted for single-cell resolution.",

    "text": "2.3 When did single-cell data become popular, and how has the technology advanced?\n\n2.3.1 The rise of single-cell data\nSingle-cell data began gaining prominence in the early 2010s, fuelled by advances in microfluidics and next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), pioneered around 2009 – 2011, was among the first methods to achieve widespread adoption. It enabled measurement of gene expression in individual cells, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk analyses masked. Early applications revealed new cell types and states, reshaped our understanding of development, and identified rare populations in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Popularity grew as throughput increased, costs fell, and workflows became standardised.\nFigure 2.19 and Figure 2.20 contrasts bulk and single-cell sequencing. Figure 2.21 shows how single-cell data tease apart different sources of heterogeneity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.19: Illustrations of how single-cell sequencing improves resolution for studying cancer resistance.

(Lei et al. 2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Expansion into other omics and spatial technologies\nBuilding on single-cell transcriptomics, the field rapidly expanded into other omics. Single-cell proteomics allows detailed analysis of protein expression and signalling pathways. Single-cell ATAC-seq profiles chromatin accessibility; Hi-C and related methods reveal 3D genome architecture. Spatial transcriptomics connects gene expression with tissue context. CRISPR-based single-cell screens enable high-throughput perturbations, and lineage-tracing barcodes add a temporal dimension, charting cell ancestry in development and disease. Together, these advances transformed single-cell biology into a multi-dimensional, integrative discipline.\nMany of these technologies appear in Figure 2.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.22: Illustration (circa 2020) of technologies that pair various omics at single-cell resolution.

Obstacles: (i) tracking the same cell over time is impossible because sequencing lyses it; (ii) longitudinal human tissue samples are rare. Strong modelling assumptions can help but must withstand biological scrutiny. The bottleneck is often data, not maths—ambitious statisticians who learn enough biology still have a fighting chance.\n\n\nRemark (Single-cell methods are largely an “associative” world): Most single-cell analyses discover mechanisms that are statistically correlational; the causal proof comes from experiments and biology.\n\nThe research inquiry starts and ends with a method: (How to integrate modalities? learn a gene-regulatory network? perform valid post-clustering tests?) Start with a statistical model and a parameter of interest \\(\\theta^*\\), then typically:\n\nDevelop a novel estimator of \\(\\theta^*\\), explaining why current methods fail (e.g. lack robustness, accuracy, power, or are heuristic). Focus on statistical logic: A clear, simple mathematical intuition should show the gap and how the new method fills it.\nProve theorems showing the estimate \\(\\hat\\theta\\) converges to \\(\\theta^*\\) under stated assumptions. Focus on consistency & convergence: More data should provably yield more accurate results (often the highlight of a statistics paper).\nSimulations demonstrating that when the true \\(\\theta^*\\) is known, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) beats competing estimators across many settings. Illustration via benchmarking: Empirically recover the correct answer more often than existing methods.\nReal-data demonstration showing results align with known biology or provide biologically sensible new insights. Focus on practicality: The method must work in real scenarios mirroring its target audience.\n\nMindset: deliver a reliable tool that others can trust as-is. Human validations are often impractical; guard-rails and diagnostics are vital.\nWhy biostatisticians need wet-lab biologists / clinicians: We rarely generate data ourselves, so collaborators supply (i) exciting data with novel questions, (ii) biological context for sensible assumptions, and (iii) experimental validation of statistical findings.\n\n\n2.4.2 How a wet-lab biologist / clinician perceives the world\nExperiments, experiments, experiments: Carefully controlled—even if small—to make downstream analysis straightforward.\nCausality comes from a chain of experiments. Suppose we study a gene’s role in disease:\n\nTemporal evidence, such as change in gene expression preceding a change in cell phenotype. A causal mechanism should occur before the phenotype.\nBiological logic providing explanation of the underlying mechanism (binding factors, protein function, evolutionary rationale, etc.). For example, there must be a coherent pathway from gene → protein → phenotype.\nUniversality of how the described association persists across cell lines or organisms. A causal mechanism should be discoverable in other systems (extent depends on how general the logic is). This is offten the highlight of a biology paper.\nValidation, such as knocking out the gene alters the outcome, whereas similar genes do not. For example, perturbing the specific gene (not its close counterparts) changes the outcome.\n\nInquiry starts and ends with a biological hypothesis: Large intellectual effort goes into proposing explanations and designing experiments to rule them in or out.\nMindset: Assemble overwhelming evidence for a mechanism, combining careful experiments and biological logic.\nWhy wet-lab scientists need biostatisticians: Data are now complex and plentiful; exhaustive experiments for every hypothesis are infeasible. Statistical methods can (i) account for data & biological complexity and (ii) prioritise hypotheses worth experimental investment.\n\nSo how does a biostatistician develop computational / statistical methods for cell biology?\n\n\nBiological context – What is the biological system and the “north-star” question? Which premises are accepted, which ones are to be tested, and why is it important to understand this mechanism better?\nTechnology, experiment, data – How are data collected and why did you choose this particular {technology, experiment, data} trio? What technical artefacts arise?\nBoundaries of current tools – Simple analyses first: what “breaks” in existing workflows? Is there preliminary evidence a new computational method would do better?\nStatistical model – What is the insight that a different computational method could interrogate the biology better? (Here the statistics training begins.)\nDevelop a method & show robustness – Robustness can be defined numerically (i.e., noise tolerance) or biologically (i.e., applicable across contexts/environments). Often, the biological question you study lacks a ground truth, so validity arguments lean on biological logic.\nUncover new / refined biology – Does the method advance our biological understanding? How confident are we that findings generalise beyond the original {technology, experiment, data} trio? (This is usually the crown-jewel of your computational biology paper – it’s not necessary your specific analyses, but the potential that your tool can be used on other biological studies beyond what you’ve demonstrated your method on.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfron, Bradley, and Robert Tibshirani. 2002. “Empirical Bayes Methods and False Discovery Rates for Microarrays.” Genetic Epidemiology 23 (1): 70–86.\n\n\nGohil, Satyen H, J Bryan Iorgulescu, David A Braun, Derin B Keskin, and Kenneth J Livak. 2021. “Applying High-Dimensional Single-Cell Technologies to the Analysis of Cancer Immunotherapy.” Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology 18 (4): 244–56.\n\n\nGolub, Todd R, Donna K Slonim, Pablo Tamayo, Christine Huard, Michelle Gaasenbeek, Jill P Mesirov, Hilary Coller, et al. 1999. “Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring.” Science 286 (5439): 531–37.\n\n\nHansson, Oskar, Kaj Blennow, Henrik Zetterberg, and Jeffrey Dage. 2023. “Blood Biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease in Clinical Practice and Trials.” Nature Aging 3 (5): 506–19.\n\n\nKepchia, Devin, Ling Huang, Richard Dargusch, Robert A Rissman, Maxim N Shokhirev, Wolfgang Fischer, and David Schubert. 2020. “Diverse Proteins Aggregate in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease Brain.” Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy 12: 1–20.\n\n\nLei, Yalan, Rong Tang, Jin Xu, Wei Wang, Bo Zhang, Jiang Liu, Xianjun Yu, and Si Shi. 2021. “Applications of Single-Cell Sequencing in Cancer Research: Progress and Perspectives.” Journal of Hematology & Oncology 14 (1): 91.\n\n\nSchaff, Dylan L, Aria J Fasse, Phoebe E White, Robert J Vander Velde, and Sydney M Shaffer. 2024. “Clonal Differences Underlie Variable Responses to Sequential and Prolonged Treatment.” Cell Systems 15 (3): 213–26.\n\n\nShalek, Alex K, and Mikael Benson. 2017. “Single-Cell Analyses to Tailor Treatments.” Science Translational Medicine 9 (408): eaan4730.\n\n\nSilva, Paulo FL da, and Björn Schumacher. 2021. “Principles of the Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Aging.” Journal of Investigative Dermatology 141 (4): 951–60.\n\n\nTeichmann, Sarah, and Mirjana Efremova. 2020. “Method of the Year 2019: Single-Cell Multimodal Omics.” Nature Methods 17 (1): 2020.\n\n\nTibshirani, Robert, Michael Saunders, Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, and Keith Knight. 2005. “Sparsity and Smoothness via the Fused Lasso.” Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B: Statistical Methodology 67 (1): 91–108.\n\n\nVerschoor, Chris P, Alina Lelic, Jonathan L Bramson, and Dawn ME Bowdish. 2015. “An Introduction to Automated Flow Cytometry Gating Tools and Their Implementation.” Frontiers in Immunology 6: 380.\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

    "text": "3.1 The sparse count matrix and the negative binomial\nASDF ASDF ASDF ASDF At the heart of single-cell sequencing data lies the sparse count matrix, where rows represent genes, columns represent cells, and entries capture the number of sequencing reads (or molecules) detected for each gene in each cell. This matrix is typically sparse because most genes are not expressed in any given cell, leading to a prevalence of zeros. The data’s sparsity reflects both the biological reality of selective gene expression and technical limitations such as sequencing depth. To model the variability in these counts, the negative binomial distribution is often employed. This distribution accommodates overdispersion, where the observed variability in gene expression counts exceeds what would be expected under simpler models like the Poisson distribution. By accounting for both biological heterogeneity and technical noise, the negative binomial provides a robust framework for analyzing sparse single-cell data.\nLet \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times p}\\) denote the single-cell data matrix with \\(n\\) cells (rows) and \\(p\\) features (columns). In a single-cell RNA-seq data matrix, the \\(p\\) features represent the \\(p\\) genes.\nHere are some basic statistics about these matrices (based mainly from my experience):\nBased on these observations, the negative binomial distribution is very commonly used.\nThe negative binomial (NB) distribution is a widely used model in single-cell RNA-seq analysis due to its ability to handle overdispersion, which is common in gene expression data. Overdispersion occurs when the variance of the data exceeds the mean, a phenomenon that cannot be captured by the Poisson distribution. The NB distribution introduces an additional parameter to model this extra variability, making it more flexible for single-cell data.\nLet us focus on the count for cell \\(i\\) and gene \\(j\\), i.e., the value \\(X_{ij}\\). The probability mass function (pmf) of the NB distribution for a random variable ( X_{ij} ) is given by:\n\\[\nP(X_{ij} = k) = \\binom{k + r_j - 1}{k} p_{ij}^r (1 - p_{ij})^k, \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere ( r_j &gt; 0 ) is the dispersion (or “overdispersion”) parameter and ( p_{ij} (0, 1) ) is the probability of success. This is the “standard” parameterization, mentioned in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution. This specific parameterization is actually not very commonly used.\nAlternatively, the NB distribution is most commonly parameterized in terms of the mean \\(\\mu_{ij}\\) and the dispersion parameter \\(r_j\\), which is often preferred in single-cell analysis:\n\\[\n\\text{Mean: } \\mu_{ij}, \\quad \\text{Variance: } \\mu_{ij} + \\frac{\\mu_{ij}^2}{r_j} = \\mu_{ij}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\mu_{ij}}{r_j}\\right).\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\n(Compare these relations to the Poisson distribution, where both the mean and variance would be \\(\\mu_{ij}\\).)\nTo relate equation Equation 3.1 to Equation 3.2, observe that we can derive,\n\\[\n\\mu_{ij} = \\frac{r_j (1 - p_{ij})}{p_{ij}}.\n\\]\nWe typically use a different overdispersion parameter \\(r_j\\) for each gene \\(j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\). Here, ( r_j ) controls the degree of overdispersion. When ( r_j ), the variance approaches the mean, and the NB distribution converges to the Poisson distribution. For single-cell RNA-seq data, the introduction of ( r_j ) allows the model to capture both the biological variability between cells and technical noise, making it robust to the sparse and overdispersed nature of gene expression data.",

    "text": "For \\(n\\), we usually have 10,000 to 500,000 cells. These cells originate from a specific set of samples/donors/organisms1. See ?fig-lupus and ?fig-zebrafish for larger examples of single-cell datasets.\n\nFor \\(p\\), we usually have about 30,000 genes (but as you’ll see, we usually limit the analysis to 2000 to 5000 genes chosen from this full set).2\n\nIn a typical scRNA-seq matrix, more than 70% of the elements are exactly 0. (And among the remaining 30%, typically half are exactly 1. The maximum count can be in the hundreds, i.e., the distribution is extremely right-skewed.) This is illustrated in Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2. We’ll see later in ?sec-scrnaseq_tech where these ``counts’’ come from.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Illustration of data from https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html showing a snippet of the count matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Illustration of data from https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html showing the percentage of cells with non-zero counts for each gene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would genes even have different overdispersions?\nWe’re assuming in most statistical models that: 1) genes are modeled as a negative binomial random variable, and 2) genes have different overdispersion parameters \\(r_j\\). Why is this reasonable? Is there a biomolecular reason for this?\nWe draw upon (sarkar2021separating?), explaining how the NB distribution is justified (both theoretically and empirically) for scRNA-seq data.\nAfter reading this paper, you’ll see that the overdispersion originates from the “biological noise” (i.e., the Gamma distribution). This differs from gene to gene because gene expression is subject to many aspects: transcriptomic bursting, the proximity between the gene and the promoter, the mRNA stability and degradation, copy number variation, the cell cycle stage, etc.\n\n\n3.1.0.1 How do you estimate the overdispersion parameter in practice?\nThe easiest way is to use MASS::glm.nb in R.\nHowever, this is very noisy for single-cell data (see Remark 3.1).\nSince we are estimate one dispersion parameter per gene, many methods use an Empirical Bayes framework to “smooth” the overdispersion parameters (love2014moderated?).\nMore sophisticated methods (such as SCTransform (hafemeister2019normalization?)) use the Bioconductor R package called glmGamPoi.\nDeep-learning methods simply incorporate estimating the dispersion parameter into the architecture and objective function, see scVI (lopez2018deep?).\nAlso, note that which we are assuming here that the overdispersion parameter \\(r_j\\) is shared across all the cells for gene \\(j\\), there are methods that also use different overdispersion parameters for different cell populations. See (chen2018umi?) or the dispersion parameter in scVI (see https://docs.scvi-tools.org/en/stable/api/reference/scvi.model.SCVI.html#scvi.model.SCVI). In general, using different overdispersion parameters for the same gene across different cell populations is not common, so my suggestion is to: 1) have a diagnostic in mind on how would you know if need to use different overdispersion parameters for the same gene, and then 2) try analyzing the genes where each gene only has one overdispersion parameter and see if you have enough concrete evidence that such a model was too simplistic.\n\nPersonal opinion: My preferred parameterization\nThe formulation Equation 3.2 by far is the most common way people write the NB distribution.\nWe typically call \\(r_j\\) the “overdispersion” parameter, since the inclusion of \\(r_j\\) in our modeling is typically to denote that there is more variance than a Poisson.\nI personally don’t like it because I find it confusing that a larger \\(r_j\\) denotes a distribution with smaller variance.\nHence, I usually write the variance as \\(\\mu_{ij}(1+\\alpha_j \\mu_{ij})\\) (where \\(\\alpha_j = 1/r_j\\)). This way, \\(\\alpha_j = 0\\) is a Poisson distribution. However, even though this makes more sense to me, it’s not commonly used. (It’s because this parameterization makes it confusing to work with the exponential-family distributions mathematically.)\nThe main takeaway is to always pay close attention to each paper’s NB parameterization. You’re looking for the mean-variance relation written somewhere in the paper to ensure you understand the author’s notation.\n\n\nRemark 3.1. What makes the negative binomial tricky Let me use an analogy that is based on the more familiar coin toss. Suppose 30 people each are given a weighted coin where the probability of heads is \\(10^{-9}\\) (basically, it’s impossible to get a heads).\nEveryone coerce and agree to a secret number \\(N\\), and everyone independently flips their own coin \\(N\\) times and records the number of heads.\nI (the moderator) do not know \\(N\\), but I get to see how many heads each person got during this experiment.\nMy goal is to estimate \\(N\\). What makes this problem very difficult?\nIf \\(N\\) were 10, or 100, or maybe even 10,000, almost everyone would get 0 heads. That is, we cannot reliably estimate \\(N\\) since the log-likelihood function is very flat. The issue is because count data has a finite resolution — 0 is always the smallest possible value, and 1 is always the second smallest value. Hence, unlike continuous values (which have “infinite resolution” in some sense), non-negative integers “lose” information the smaller the range is.",

    "text": "5.1 Review of the central dogma\nThe central dogma of molecular biology outlines the flow of genetic information within a cell: DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is then translated into protein (see Figure 5.1). Specifically, coding genes in DNA are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which serves as a template for protein synthesis. During translation, mRNA sequences are read in sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each corresponding to a specific amino acid. These amino acids are then linked together to form proteins, which carry out a vast array of functions within the cell. While this process provides a foundational framework, it is a dramatic over-simplification. As we’ll explore later in the course, the correlation between a gene and its corresponding protein levels is often surprisingly low, highlighting the complexity of gene expression regulation.\nUnderstanding proteins is crucial because they are the primary effectors of cellular function. Most cellular activities — whether structural, enzymatic, or signaling—are mediated by proteins. While RNA intermediates, such as mRNA, play important roles in carrying genetic information, the majority of RNA fragments never leave the cell, with a few exceptions like extracellular RNA in communication. Proteins, however, directly influence both intracellular processes and extracellular interactions. Given the weak correlation between genes and proteins and the central role proteins play in biological function, studying proteins arguably provides a more direct and meaningful insight into cellular and organismal behavior. This dual perspective on the central dogma will frame much of our exploration in this course.1",

Historically, determining protein shapes required experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy (EM) (see Figure 5.5), or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which are resource-intensive and time-consuming. AlphaFold uses deep learning and structural biology insights to achieve high accuracy.\nHowever, significant challenges remain. There are still many open questions on how specific genetic modifications impact protein folding, how proteins dynamically change their conformation, or how they interact with other molecules such as DNA or other proteins. Additionally, ongoing developments in using large language models are showing promise in predicting not only shape but also potential functions directly from amino acid sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: From (jumper2021highly?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: From https://myscope.training/CRYO_Introducing_Single_Particle_Analysis, as an example of what cryo-EM data “looks like,” just to give you a brief glimpse on how people study protein structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Other Methods: Flow Cytometry, Spatial Proteomics, and FISH\nWhile AlphaFold focuses on protein structure, methods like flow cytometry and spatial proteomics explore proteins in their functional and cellular contexts. Flow cytometry, sometimes considered the “original” single-cell data method, measures the expression of surface and intracellular proteins across thousands of cells, providing rich insights into cellular heterogeneity. Spatial proteomics and techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) take this further by localizing proteins and RNA within tissue contexts, enabling researchers to map molecular interactions in their native environments. These approaches highlight the versatility of protein studies, from understanding their structure to dissecting their function and distribution in complex systems. While not the focus of this course, these methods are invaluable in expanding our understanding of proteins and their roles in biology.",

    "text": "6.1 Primer on the genome, epigenetics, and enhancers\nThe genome is the complete set of DNA within an organism, encoding the instructions for life. While every cell in an organism typically contains the same genome, different cells exhibit distinct phenotypes and functions. This diversity arises not from changes in the underlying DNA sequence but from epigenetic regulation—heritable modifications that influence gene expression without altering the DNA itself. Epigenetics includes processes like DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin accessibility, all of which contribute to the dynamic regulation of gene activity in response to developmental cues and environmental signals.\nEnhancers play a critical role in this regulatory landscape. These are DNA sequences that, while not coding for proteins themselves, can dramatically increase the transcription of target genes. Enhancers act by binding specific transcription factors, proteins that recognize and attach to DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. Some transcription factors require assistance from chaperone proteins, which ensure their proper folding and functionality, or pioneer proteins, which can access and open tightly packed chromatin to allow other factors to bind. This interplay highlights the complexity of the regulatory machinery that governs cellular function. See Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2 to appreciate how complex this machinery is.",

    "section": "6.2 The zoo of epigenetic modalities",
    "text": "6.2 The zoo of epigenetic modalities\nEpigenetics encompasses a vast array of molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These mechanisms include modifications to DNA, RNA, chromatin, and the spatial organization of the genome, collectively forming a complex regulatory landscape. Below are some of the key modalities studied in epigenetics:\n\nDNA Accessibility: Techniques like ATAC-seq and DNase-seq measure how accessible DNA is to transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. Accessible regions often overlap with promoters and enhancers, providing critical insights into gene regulation. (This is what we’ll focus on this chapter.)\nDNA Methylation1: This modification, typically at cytosines in CpG dinucleotides, is a key epigenetic mark associated with gene silencing. Tools like bisulfite sequencing are used to map methylation patterns across the genome, revealing their roles in development and disease. See Figure 6.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: From (gauba2021immunomodulation?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: From (bruggeman2008using?).\n\n\n\n\n\nHi-C and Genome Organization2: Hi-C measures chromatin interactions to reveal the three-dimensional structure of the genome. It uncovers features like topologically associating domains (TADs) and enhancer-promoter loops, which are crucial for understanding how spatial organization influences gene regulation. See Figure 6.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: From (ea2015contribution?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: From (liu2021seeing?).\n\n\n\n\n\nHistone Modifications3: Post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, occur on histone proteins and regulate chromatin structure. Techniques like ChIP-seq and the newer Cut & Tag method are used to map these modifications and their role in gene expression at the bulk level. See Figure 6.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: From https://opened.cuny.edu/courseware/lesson/684/student/?section=2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: From (steinbach2017pten?). (Note: This is an example of the “canonical” functions of common histone modifications. This is by no means exhaustive and guaranteed to hold true for all biological systems.)\n\n\n\n\nSome of you might be interested: Personally, I think one of the fascinating concepts based on histone modifications is bivalent chromatin (essentially, chromatin that is wrapped in such a way that is simultaneously activated and silenced), see Figure 6.9. It’s a particularly curious phenomenon that entire labs dedicate themselves to studying. See (blanco2020bivalent?) for an overview why this mechanism might be “beneficial.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: From (macrae2023regulation?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: From (glancy2024bivalent?).\n\n\n\n\n\nRNA Modifications (m6A and Pseudouridine): Modifications like N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and pseudouridine occur on RNA molecules and are involved in processes like splicing, translation, and mRNA decay. See Figure 6.11 for what pseudouridine is, i.e., “a rotation of the uridine molecule.” These modifications add an epitranscriptomic layer to gene regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: From (hamma2006pseudouridine?) about pseudouridine.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntranslated Regions (UTRs): Before talking about UTRs, it’s probably good to review what an mRNA fragment “looks like” at the different stages of transcription and translation, see Figure 6.12. The 5′ and 3′ UTRs contain regulatory elements that influence mRNA stability, localization, and translation efficiency. The 3′ UTR, in particular, serves as a binding platform for RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs, providing an additional layer of post-transcriptional gene regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: From (niazi2023rna?). Notice the splicing (i.e., “removal” of the introns – see Alternative Splicing below) and that the protein-coding region is not the only part of the mRNA transcript – there are also the UTRs and poly-A tail. NOTE: The transcription start site (TSS) is not the same place as the promoter. The promoter is usually an un-transcribed region upstream of the TSS, while the TSS is where transcription actually starts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: From (mignone2002untranslated?).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.14: From https://www.cambio.co.uk/9/257/applications/methods/in-vitro-transcription/mrna-therapeutics/.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Splicing: This post-transcriptional process generates multiple mRNA isoforms from the same gene, expanding the proteomic diversity, see Figure 6.15. This is a combinatorial explosion of isoforms. While not traditionally classified as epigenetic, splicing often intersects with chromatin modifications and RNA-binding proteins, blurring the lines between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.15: From (chen2015alternative?).\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Polyadenylation (APA): APA generates transcript isoforms with different 3′ ends, affecting mRNA stability, localization, and translation, see Figure 6.16. By selecting distinct cleavage sites, APA alters the 3′ UTR length without affecting the poly-A tail itself, thereby modulating interactions with regulatory factors such as microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.16: From Li et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\nEfforts like the ENCODE project (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7061942/) have systematically mapped these modalities across cell types and tissues, creating a comprehensive resource for understanding genome function. ENCODE has provided invaluable datasets on DNA accessibility, histone modifications, and RNA-binding proteins, enabling researchers to uncover how epigenetic and transcriptomic layers work together to drive cellular processes.\nFinally, tools like MPRA (Massively Parallel Reporter Assays) are revolutionizing how we study enhancers and regulatory sequences. MPRA allows researchers to test thousands of DNA fragments for their regulatory activity, providing functional validation for epigenetic marks. This growing zoo of modalities continues to expand our understanding of how the genome is dynamically regulated in health and disease.\nSee Figure 6.17 for some courageous figures that try to display multiple types of epigenetic modifications all at once. See (lim2024advances?) for a broad overview about the different types of technologies to sequence different omics and layers of epigenetics, and how they are getting computationally put together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.17: From https://www.sc-best-practices.org/chromatin_accessibility/introduction.html.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.18: From https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/type-2-diabetes-mellitus-and-epigenetics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClaringbould, Annique, and Judith B Zaugg. 2021. “Enhancers in Disease: Molecular Basis and Emerging Treatment Strategies.” Trends in Molecular Medicine 27 (11): 1060–73.\n\n\nIto, Shinsuke, Nando Dulal Das, Takashi Umehara, and Haruhiko Koseki. 2022. “Factors and Mechanisms That Influence Chromatin-Mediated Enhancer–Promoter Interactions and Transcriptional Regulation.” Cancers 14 (21): 5404.\n\n\nLi, Lei, Yumei Li, Xudong Zou, Fuduan Peng, Ya Cui, Eric J Wagner, and Wei Li. 2022. “Population-Scale Genetic Control of Alternative Polyadenylation and Its Association with Human Diseases.” Quantitative Biology 10 (1): 44–54.",

    "text": "7.2 Basis on how to infer history from cells naturally\nCertain features in a cell’s genetic material serve as natural markers for tracing lineage. These features arise spontaneously or accumulate over time, and researchers can compare them across related cells to reconstruct branching histories.\n\nMitochondrial DNA (somatic mutations):\nMitochondrial genomes can pick up small mutations as cells divide. (Note! There are a lot of types of other DNA in your cells beyond the typical DNA we think of in the 23 pairs of chromosomes. Your mitochondria has its own DNA.) By measuring these mutations, one can infer which cells share a common ancestor and roughly estimate how many divisions have occurred. However, because the mutation rate is not always high, it can be difficult to achieve fine-grained resolution.\nDNA copy number:\nGains or losses in chromosome segments, known as copy number variations, can also serve as lineage markers. Though useful for distinguishing large-scale genomic shifts, such variations do not necessarily arise in a predictable manner. This makes it challenging to reproducibly track precise cell-to-cell histories.\nFor examples of bulk-DNA phylogenetic tree, see . This is a massive field, so one citation is not doing this field justice. We’ll see this more in Section 8.3.\nDNA methylation:\nDNA methylation serves as another naturally occurring cellular barcode. Over time, cells acquire unique methylation patterns that reflect their lineage history. These epigenetic marks regulate gene expression and can be stably inherited through cell divisions. Because different tissues and cell types exhibit distinct methylation landscapes, analyzing these patterns can provide a historical record of a cell’s developmental path. However, while DNA methylation is useful for lineage tracing, its resolution is limited by the variability in methylation turnover rates and the difficulty of distinguishing cell-to-cell differences in a reproducible manner.\n\nThese naturally occurring barcodes, while informative, can be limiting in resolution. They may not mutate or appear frequently enough to trace detailed branching events. Additionally, reproducing the exact timing of such genetic changes in the wet lab can be difficult, making it hard to pinpoint when and how they impacted lineage formation.",

While powerful, these methods rely on assumptions about the smoothness of transitions and may not capture rare events or subtle branching.\nLineage tracing complements snapshot-based methods by providing a direct record of which cells arose from the same ancestor.

    "text": "7.4 Reconstruction phylogenetic tree from scLT\nThe goal in this section is to provide a high-level overview of how we can reconstruct phylogenetic trees from single-cell lineage tracing (scLT) dataset, if we are using mutating barcodes. Remember, in single-cell sequencing experiments, we never get to see anything “directly” aside from sequences (of RNA, DNA, etc.) So we need to “estimate” the phylogenetic tree itself using the barcode edits. See Figure 7.7 for a conceptual illustration of this problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: From Li et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\nConceptually, this is our goal in a cartoon setting. (Technically, most lineage-tracing methods based on lentiviral barcodes return a claudogram (i.e., the edge lengths do not carry “time-information.” This is in contrast with a phylogram, where edge denote “amount of elapsed time since the branching event”). See Figure 7.8 and Figure 7.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: From https://microbenotes.com/phylogenetic-tree/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: From https://microbenotes.com/phylogenetic-tree/\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.1 Brief review: Number of rooted trees\nGiven \\(n\\) nodes, how many possible phylogenetic trees are possible? Couldn’t we just enumerate all possible trees with \\(n\\) leaves, and determine which one is the “best one”? Think of this as a “caveman” optimization approach. All I need is a function that evaluates the “data agreement” score of a tree. Then, given single-cell data (either of scLT or copy numbers) of \\(n\\) cells, I can write down all possible trees (agnostic of data), and then pick the tree with the score that best agrees with data. What’s wrong with this approach?\nThe issue is that there is an explosion of possible trees. Let’s establish some ground rules. We will only talk about fully connected, binary, rooted trees where the \\(n\\) nodes are the leaves.\n\n\\(n\\) leaves: The \\(n\\) cells we observed are set to be leaves (sometimes called terminal nodes). (After all, we sequence all the cells at once, so we don’t actually observe the “parent” cell that divided to yield the two daughter cells we sequenced. Remember, over time, cells undergo mitosis to split into 2 cells.)\nFully connected and directed: All \\(n\\) leaves are connected by one graph. These \\(n\\) nodes are connected by \\(n-1\\) intermediate (unobserved) nodes.\nBinary and rooted: Every one of the \\(n-1\\) intermediate nodes has 2 children nodes. These children nodes could be one of the \\(n\\) leaves or one of the other intermediate nodes. Furthermore, every node has a parent except one special node called the “root node.” You can think of the root node as the common (unobserved) ancestor that spawned all the \\(n\\) cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: From https://microbenotes.com/phylogenetic-tree/\n\n\n\n\nWith these ground rules in place, we can prove the following result.\n\nGiven \\(n\\) named leaves, there are \\((2n - 3)!!\\) (where the \\(!!\\) denotes a double factorial1) possible rooted binary trees.\n\nHere is an informal sketch of the proof.\n\nWe prove that the number of fully resolved (binary) rooted phylogenetic trees on \\(n\\) labeled taxa (leaves) is given by\n\\[\nT_n = (2n - 3)!! = 1 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times \\cdots \\times (2n - 3),\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nvia induction.\nBase Case (\\(n=2\\)):\nFor \\(n=2\\), there is exactly one fully resolved rooted tree, consisting of a root node with two children (the two labeled leaves). Hence,\n\\[\nT_2 = 1.\n\\]\nInductive Step:\nAssume that for \\(n-1\\) leaves, the number of fully resolved rooted trees is given by \\(T_{n-1}\\). We show that the number of such trees for \\(n\\) leaves satisfies the recurrence relation\n\\[\nT_n = (2n - 3) \\times T_{n-1}.\n\\]\nTo form an \\(n\\)-leaf tree from a \\((n-1)\\)-leaf tree, we consider a particular \\((n-1)\\)-leaf tree and “split” one node. (By splitting, think of a “cherry” — a node with 2 children. We will take a node, set that to be a new internal node where one of its children is the original sub-tree of the node we picked, and the other child is the new leaf node for the \\(n\\)-leaf tree.)\nHence, we need to count how many possible nodes are available to split. In a fully resolved tree with \\(n-1\\) leaves, we have \\(n-2\\) internal nodes (i.e., “unobserved cells”), one of which is the root, and therefore, we have a total of \\((n-1)+(n-2) = 2n - 3\\) nodes.\nTherefore, there are \\((2n - 3)\\) such choices how to “split” a \\((n-1)\\)-leaf tree.\nSince there are \\(T_{n-1}\\) possible \\((n-1)\\)-leaf trees, (of which we have \\((2n - 3)\\) choices on how to form a \\(n\\)-leaf tree2), we have the relation,\n\\[\nT_n = (2n - 3) \\times T_{n-1}.\n\\]\n\nFor example, this means\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nT_3 &= (2 \\times 3 - 3) \\times \\underbrace{T_2}_{=1} = 3, \\\\\nT_4 &= (2 \\times 4 - 3) \\times \\underbrace{T_3}_{=3} = (2 \\times 4 - 3) \\times (2 \\times 3 - 3) \\times 1 = 15.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSee Figure 7.11 for the trees enumerated.\nUsing the base case \\(T_2 = 1\\), repeated application of this recurrence gives\n\\[\nT_n = (2n - 3)!!.\n\\]\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: From https://www.megasoftware.net/mega1_manual/Phylogeny.html\n\n\n\n\nSee (and related papers) for more context.\nSo… why is this result important? Observe that \\(n!!\\) is super exponential (i.e., it grows faster than an exponential3). So if you have \\(n=1000\\) cells, the number of possible trees you’ll try to enumerate is on the order of \\(1000^{1000} = 10^{3000}\\), which is way too many. See Figure 7.12.\nTherefore, when constructing phylogenetic trees, we need to be mathematically clever (probably with the help of some heuristic). Can we use some heuristic to drastically reduce the number of trees we’re going to even consider, and we can use our sequencing data of these \\(n\\) cells to help us in this endeavor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.12: From https://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/cheng_courses/slides9.pdf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Camin-Sokal maximum parsimony method\nThe Camin-Sokal maximum parsimony method is a phylogenetic reconstruction technique that aims to infer evolutionary relationships by minimizing the number of changes required to explain observed character states. (You’ll see this come up a lot when reading papers that reconstruct the phylogenetic tree from scLT data with mutating barcodes. You can think of this as the “baseline method” that every sc-phylogenetic method compares itself to.)\nThis method assumes that character states can only evolve in one direction, meaning once a trait is gained, it cannot be lost. Given a set of taxa and their character states, the algorithm constructs a tree that explains these states with the fewest evolutionary steps. While this method is computationally efficient for small datasets, it may oversimplify biological reality by enforcing irreversible character changes, limiting its applicability in cases where traits can reappear or revert.",

    "text": "7.5 Lentiviral lineage tracing\n\n7.5.1 About the technology and application\nLentiviral approaches offer a more controlled way to label and track cell lineages. By inserting a known genetic barcode into cells, scientists can reliably follow how these labeled cells expand and diversify over time. See Figure 7.13, Figure 7.14, and Figure 7.15.\n\nIn static lineage barcoding, a lentivirus delivers a stable transgene (for example, GFP or RFP) containing a unique sequence in its untranslated region (UTR) to be integrated into the cell’s DNA. All progeny of an infected cell inherit this same sequence, making it straightforward to group related cells.\n(This won’t be the focus of the following sections. In static lineage barcoding, there is no phylogenetic tree. All the cell lineage information is relative to when the lentivirus was introduced to your cells.)\nIn mutating barcoding (or also called evolving barcode), a guide RNA (via CRISPR-Cas9) can introduce variations sometimes into a transgene reporter (a gene artificially integrated into the cell’s DNA) at various target sites.\nThis creates barcodes as “genetic scars” in descendant cells. This dynamic approach can provide a richer record of how cells diverge and acquire distinct identities.\n(There’s a lot more complexity to this. Here are some concerns that are a bit easier to explain:\n\nYou need make sure the Cas9 protein is continually being expressed over the course of the experiment.\n\nYou need to make sure you have enough diversity in the genetic scars that it’s unlikely two unrelated cells happened to acquire the same set of scars.\n\nThese CRISPR double-stranded breaks can lead to sometimes large deletion events. If there’s not a lot of different locations the transgene was integrated into the genome, or if the target sites are too close, then the multiple target sites might be deleted at once4.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.13: From Weinreb et al. (2020), an example of static barcode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.14: From Chan et al. (2019), an example of evolving barcode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.15: From Jones, Yang, and Weissman (2023).\n\n\n\n\nSee for fantastic overviews on both types of technologies.\nWhat can we do with this? As shown in Figure 7.16, in the cancer setting, we can use lineage barcoding to directly observe many qualities of cancer cells. See Figure 7.17 for a broader overview of different technologies and what biological insights they can reveal (based on what kind of information we can reconstruct from the barcode).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.16: From Jones, Yang, and Weissman (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.17: From VanHorn and Morris (2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.2 For more reading on this technology\nSee , all of which are reviews that document the various ways labs have designed systems to record cellular history.\n\n\n7.5.3 Cassiopeia, for scLT barcodes: Illustrating a non-probabilistic modeling approach\nIn many CRISPR-lineage systems, each target site transitions exactly once from unedited to some specific indel state, and cannot revert (i.e., irreversible). This constraint helps reduce the multi-state problem to something akin to a binary “perfect phylogeny” assumption. However, real data can deviate from a true perfect phylogeny due to parallel evolution of the same indel or missing data.\n\nInput/Output. The input to Cassiopeia is the \\(\\{\\texttt{NA}, 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times m}\\) matrix of \\(n\\) cells and \\(m\\) possible target sites (i.e., Cas9-induced heritable insertions or deletions happened, also called indels). This is sometimes called the “character matrix”. Here, NA refers to “missing” (sometimes encoded as \\(-1\\) instead). 0 refers to the baseline sequence (i.e., unedited). Any positive integer (\\(1, 2, \\ldots\\)) denotes a categorical variable, that is, the type of indel mutation that happened at this site.\nThe output is a phylogenetic tree that is rooted binary where each of the \\(n\\) sequenced cells is a leaf, but this tree does not contain any temporal information about how “far in the past” the cell divisions happened (i.e., it’s a cladogram, not a phylogram).\nNotice that no scRNA-seq (gene expression) matrix is needed. All the sequencing that’s needed was to determine the genetic modifications at the target sites for these \\(n\\) cells.\n\nCassiopeia offers a couple different ways to construct its trees. We highlight two of these options below.\n\nCassiopeia-ILP (Steiner Tree Formulation):\nFirst, Cassiopeia-ILP constructs a directed acyclic “potential graph” whose vertices represent all plausible ancestral states (including the \\(n\\) observed leaves), and edges represent possible single-step mutations. The algorithm repeatedly merges pairs of nodes with a shared ancestor if they differ by a valid mutation, generating internal vertices. A user-defined parameter controls how large this potential graph may grow (to avoid excessive computational cost).\nOnce the potential graph \\(G\\) is built, the algorithm solves the Steiner tree problem on \\(G\\) with a flow-based integer linear programming (ILP). The ILP ensures each observed cell is reached from the root (the unmutated state) by a minimal set of edges, minimizing the total number of mutation events. This method is exact but can be computationally slow for large \\(n\\).\n\n\nThe Steiner tree problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks the shortest possible network connecting a given set of points (terminals) while allowing additional intermediate points (Steiner nodes) to reduce the total length. In the context of evolutionary biology and phylogenetics, the Steiner tree approach can be used to infer ancestral relationships by identifying the most parsimonious connections between observed species. The problem is NP-hard, meaning exact solutions are computationally infeasible for large datasets. However, various heuristic and approximation algorithms have been developed to efficiently construct near-optimal Steiner trees in practical applications.\nThis is different from computing the minimal spanning tree because we don’t need the Steiner tree to include every node in \\(G\\). We just need it to contain the \\(n\\) leaves (i.e., the cells we actually observed). There might be hypothetical intermediate nodes (i.e., ancestral cells) in \\(G\\) that are not deemed necessary to be included in the output Steiner tree. See Figure 7.18 and Figure 7.19.\n\n(In short, you can imagine the first step of forming the potential graph \\(G\\) is to limit the space of possible phylogenetic trees — the returned tree must be a tree formed by the edges in \\(G\\). Then, in the second step, we formulate an ILP reminiscent of the Steiner tree problem to find the most “appropriate” tree.)\n\nCassiopeia-Greedy:\nThis algorithm builds the tree top-down, repeatedly choosing the most “frequent” or highest-priority mutation (unmutated \\(\\to\\) indel) to partition the cells into two subsets: those that carry that mutation vs. those that do not (i.e., it’s “greedy”).\nBecause CRISPR edits are irreversible, each multi-state site behaves effectively like a one-time event from an uncut state. Thus, one can treat each new indel as a potential splitting event. Cells with missing values at the chosen splitting site are assigned to whichever subset their non-missing edits best match. This step recurses until subsets become single cells or until all characters are used.\nGreedy is fast and scales to tens of thousands of cells, but may produce suboptimal solutions if extensive parallel evolution exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.18: From Jones et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.19: From Jones et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5.4 Some implementation notes\n\nPriors on Indel Frequencies. Optionally, Cassiopeia can leverage empirical estimates of each indel’s probability to prioritize rare-but-frequent states (mitigating parallel evolution).\nMissing Data. Both ILP and greedy approaches accommodate missing data by enumerating or heuristically assigning cells to the most compatible subset.\n\n\n\n7.5.5 I’m very confused. Can you give me some more details?\nThere’s a lot of moving components since the lineage barcode data for mutating barcodes is quite unlike anything else we’ve seen in this course so far. Let me go through an example from https://cassiopeia-lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/reconstruct.html (the Cassiopeia tutorial itself) to tell you what the “input data” for Cassiopeia is. (Once you understand the input data and how it was preprocessed, it’ll become clear what the output is.)\nIn a typical mutating lineage barcoding experiment, you get a bunch of gDNA or gRNA reads about the sequences of the barcodes that integrated into each cell. Then, you run bioinformatics code to align these sequences to a known reference genome to determine what happened at each target site of a cell’s barcode (i.e., did a mutation happen, if so, what was the insertion or deletion event, etc.). This is described in https://cassiopeia-lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/preprocess.html. The output of this is an allele table that might look like Figure 7.20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.20: From https://cassiopeia-lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/reconstruct.html. We are showing 10 different integrated barcodes intBC (each with three target sites, r1 to r3) for the cell with RW.TTTGCGCCAAGAAAGG.\nSo you should expect every unique cell (i.e., unique cellBC) to have one or more integrated barcodes (for example, 10, as shown here). Furthermore, you hope that many different cells have the same integrated barcode, such as CTAGGGCATCTACG. (This is because you’re going to compare what happened at different target sites for cells that have the same integrated barcode to determine how these cells are related.)\nFor instance, in integrated barcode CTAGGGCATCTACG, we see at the first target site, CCGAA[None]AAATG, the None means there was no insertion or deletion event found at this site (relative to all the other sequences at the r1 region of this integrated barcode in the other cells).\nIn contrast, at the third target site r3, we see ATTCG[221:1D]GGAGG. This means at relative position 221 in this target site, there was a deletion that resulted in 1 base pair being deleted. (You can see in this screenshot that some of the deletion events can go up to 80+ base pairs, such as TGGCG[86:81D]CTCTG.) This large deletion event is okay (as long as it didn’t result in the deletion of a different target site) if the sequence alignment step could still determine that the flanking sequences to the deletion (in this case, TGGCG to the left and CTCTG to the right) still aligned to the reasonable positions to the target site for this barcode. Remember, you know what the full sequences of all these integrated barcodes are because these are all sequences you designed to be integrated into the cell’s DNA. See PCT48.ref.fasta in https://cassiopeia-lineage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/preprocess.html.\n\n\n\n\nThis character matrix is the input to Cassiopeia — it now knows the type of mutation at each of the target sites for every cell, and then it’s going to try to estimate a phylogenetic tree from this.\n\n\n7.5.6 A brief note on other approaches\nCassiopeia doesn’t directly tell you some crucial pieces of information that you might want to know:\n1) how far in the past was the division (i.e., the “branch length”), and\n2) how fast are mutations happening (i.e., the “mutation rate”)?\nFor these, you could invoke more involved methods such as GAPML or ICE-FASE . On a different line of thinking, methods like LinTIMaT rely on using the lineage barcoding data alongside the scRNA-seq data (which tells you how similar two cells are based on either their annotated cell-types or expressed pathways) to construct phylogenetic trees.",

    "text": "7.6 Natural lineage barcodes via copy number alterations (CNA)\n\n7.6.1 About the technology and application\nOne of the goals of why studying copy number variation in Section 8.3 was to understand cellular dynamics. So… how is this done?\nCopy number alterations (CNAs) are a hallmark of many cancers and arise due to genomic instability within tumor cells (refer back to ?fig-copy-number-cancer). Because cancer is often driven by such genomic instabilities, CNAs serve as a natural “barcode” of lineage. By tracking which genes or regions of chromosomes have been duplicated or lost over time, researchers can infer how subclones evolve and expand. These aberrations not only reveal how aggressive a tumor might be, but can also hint at its capacity for metastasis. Indeed, it is quite common to see particular copy number events that are associated with advanced disease states or resistance to therapy.\nAnother key advantage of using CNAs in cancer research is the ability to reconstruct phylogenetic trees of tumor evolution at single-cell resolution. Traditional bulk sequencing can obscure the heterogeneity of a tumor by averaging out signals across thousands or millions of cells, making it difficult to identify rare but important subpopulations. By examining individual cells, we can trace how specific lineages emerged, which mutations or copy number changes appeared first, and how these have proliferated. This level of detail helps us pinpoint the subclones that might be the most aggressive or metastatic, and may reveal new therapeutic targets based on the genetic changes that drove each lineage.\nFurthermore, once a phylogenetic tree is built from copy number data, the specific chromosomal regions that underwent duplication or deletion can yield insight into the biology of the tumor. Some genomic loci harbor oncogenes or tumor suppressors, so gains or losses in these regions can be especially detrimental—or beneficial, from the tumor’s perspective. Such events might correlate with faster growth, immune evasion, or other clinically significant traits. By focusing on these recurrently altered regions, researchers and clinicians can identify potential biomarkers for prognosis or drug targets for personalized therapy. See Figure 7.21 as an example of what this workflow looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.21: From Lu (2025). Imagine we have longitudinal samples of a person. Those tissue samples get single-cell sequenced. Then a variant calling happens, and then we want to learn a clone tree, which is the focus for the type of tree we’re discussing in these notes.\n\n\n\n\nThese output phylogenetic trees might look like the ones in Figure 7.22 and Figure 7.23.\n(As a sidenote: be sure to understand what the branch lengths mean in a phylogenetic tree. Here, these branch lengths denote the “distance” between two cells’ CNA profiles. (The longer the branch, the more it’s different.) Other methods use the branch length to denote time, i.e., the longer the branch, the more time has elapsed since the branching event. Most methods (in my experience) do not give you branch lengths relative to time, since this would require you (the data analyst) to provide the method with more biological information. For example, how fast do certain CNA events happen? You would need to provide this additional information to your phylogenetic method for it to know how to estimate branch lengths that denote time.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.22: From Weiner and Bansal (2025).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.23: From Kaufmann et al. (2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.2 COMPASS, for scDNA copy number: Illustrating a probabilistic approach\nCOMPASS (Joint Copy Number and Mutation Phylogeny from Amplicon Single-Cell DNA Sequencing) is a probabilistic model designed to reconstruct a branching evolutionary tree of SNVs (single-nucleotide variants) and CNAs (copy number alterations) from single-cell DNA sequencing data. It accommodates both allele-specific copy number changes (loss, gain, copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) and single-nucleotide events, all integrated into a single phylogenetic structure.\n(In COMPASS, there are meaningful branch lengths. The output is simply a cladogram.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.24: From . Some basic terminology: 1) SNV (Single Nucleotide Variant): A change in a single nucleotide of the DNA sequence.\n2) Loss: (Not shown in this figure) A deletion of one copy of a chromosomal region. For instance, in the usual 23 pairs of human chromosomes, one region could be deleted from one copy of Chromosome 1, while remaining intact on the other copy.\n3) CNLOH (Copy-Neutral Loss of Heterozygosity): A copy number alteration that preserves the total number of chromosome copies but still removes heterozygosity. In other words, the cell ends up with the same number of copies overall, yet the two copies become identical (losing heterozygosity).\n4) Gain: The opposite of a “loss.” This could involve duplicating a specific chromosomal region (thus elongating that chromosome) or duplicating the entire chromosome (leading to three copies of Chromosome 1, instead of the usual two).\n\n\n\n\n\nInput/Output. The input to COMPASS is\n1) \\(D \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+^{n \\times d}\\) denoting the total read count per DNA region (among \\(d\\) regions) for each of the \\(n\\) cells, and\ntwo matrices \\(X, Y \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+^{n \\times d}\\) denoting the number of DNA reads containing each SNV (among \\(d\\) SNVs) among the \\(n\\) cells.\nFor example, let \\(X_{ij}\\) denote the number of DNA reads from cell \\(i\\) that contained the major allele (i.e., “reference”) for SNV \\(j\\), and \\(Y_{ij}\\) denote likewise but for the minor allele (i.e., “alternative”) for SNV \\(j\\).\nThe output is a cladogram among the \\(n\\) cells. More specifically, COMPASS outputs a tree where the “internal nodes” denote what type of mutation happened, and cells are “attached” to these internal nodes (denoting that this cell followed this specific sequence of mutations, starting from the root of the tree).\n\nHere are the overall ideas of COMPASS. Both total coverage (for copy number inference) and allele-specific coverage (for LOH and SNV calling) are going to be part of the likelihood to help model the likelihood of a particular tree (which will be used to determine the tree that best fits the data).\n\nModel constraints:\nCOMPASS models four classes of mutations:\n\nSNVs, each occurring exactly once in the tree,\n\nLoss, which removes one copy of an allele in a region,\n\nGain, which increases the copy number of a region, and\n\nCNLOH (copy-neutral LOH), which replaces one allele with another while keeping total copy number constant.\n\nEach region can undergo CNAs at most once per lineage. When subclones exhibit multiple consecutive CNAs in a region, COMPASS in practice uses a single-event approximation to avoid ambiguous high copy numbers. (This is a parsimonious principle, in some sense. We’re dramatically limiting the number of trees that are going to be considered with these constraints.)\nCoverage and allelic likelihoods:\nThere are two components to model the likelihood, one for the SNVs, one for the CNAs.\n\nFor the CNAs, we have a coverage model. COMPASS uses a negative binomial distribution for each region’s total reads to capture overdispersion. Each region \\(j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,d\\}\\) is assigned a baseline coverage weight \\(\\rho_k\\) (reflecting primer efficiency, etc.), so if a cell’s node in the phylogeny has copy number \\(\\text{cn}_k\\), the expected read depth is scaled accordingly.\nFor the SNVs, we have an allelic model. For each locus \\(j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\), COMPASS directly uses read counts \\((\\text{REF}_i, \\text{ALT}_i)\\) under a Beta-Binomial model, allowing for overdispersion in allele fraction. Each variant has a dropout rate \\(\\mu_i\\), reflecting the probability that a given allele is lost (PCR failure), and the method marginalizes over all possible dropout configurations (\\(k\\) reference copies vs. \\(l\\) alternate copies).\n\nCell-to-node assignments:\n(Here, “node” refers to a mutation event, which are internal nodes in our tree.) COMPASS marginalizes over cell attachments to genotype nodes. Let \\(\\pi_k\\) be a prior probability that any cell is attached to node \\(k\\). The algorithm thus sums\n\\[\n\\sum_{k} \\pi_k \\, \\prod_{i=1}^{p} P(\\text{region reads}|\\dots) \\,\\prod_{i=1}^{d} P(\\text{allelic reads}|\\dots)\n\\]\nfor each cell.\nSimulated annealing:\nSimulated annealing is a useful statistical technique for reconstructing a phylogenetic tree from single-cell DNA data because we want to search through a vast space of possible evolutionary histories5. Each candidate tree is defined by how individual copy number events and mutations are arranged and passed down through successive subclones.\n\nA naive or purely greedy search might easily get stuck in suboptimal solutions, given the noisy nature of single-cell data and the combinatorial explosion of possible trees. By gradually “cooling” the exploration of this space — starting from more random moves and then narrowing down to finer adjustments — simulated annealing helps ensure that the final solution is not merely a local optimum. In other words, this strategy balances the need for broad exploration early on with the requirement of a precise, fine-grained search later, thereby increasing the likelihood of discovering a high-probability lineage structure.\nCOMPASS employs a simulated annealing approach over the discrete space of trees:\n\nStart with a random initial tree (random parent pointers, random SNV allocation, no CNAs).\nPropose local “moves” (adding or removing a node, reassigning mutations, introducing or removing a CNA, etc.).\nAccept or reject based on the ratio of posterior probabilities at a current “temperature” to allow exploration; gradually decrease the temperature to refine solutions.\n\nTo simulate potential trees, we need a prior distribution over trees. COMPASS will pick a prior to discourage trees with excessive branching or excessive CNA events. Specifically, it penalizes the total number of nodes and the number of CNA events. Longer CNAs across consecutive amplicons are treated as a single event. CNLOH events may be penalized more due to their strong effect on the allelic fraction.\nParameter Updates. Node weights \\(\\{\\pi_k\\}\\) (i.e., the probability any cell is attached to an internal node) and other parameters are estimated by an Expectation-Maximization (EM) step:\n\nE-step: Compute the posterior probabilities that cell \\(i\\) belongs to node \\(k\\), given the current tree and parameters.\nM-step: Update \\(\\pi_k\\) as the average posterior membership across cells.\n\nThis EM routine is invoked each time we propose or accept a new tree in the simulated annealing.\n(The EM algorithm is another useful statistical technique whenever you’re dealing with a model with unobserved variables. Here, our unobserved variable is whether or not a cell \\(i\\) is attached to node \\(k\\).)\nSee Figure 7.25 for an illustration of what the results could look like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.25: From Sollier et al. (2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6.3 A brief note on other approaches\nSo… what exactly are these trees good for?\nAs we’ve mentioned, you can see in Figure 7.25 that COMPASS is trying to learn the mutation event that happened at each node. (This gives us a clue on how deleterious the mutation event is. As a simple example, if there was a loss in copy number in a region that contains a cancer suppressive gene, we might expect rapid proliferation of this cancer cell.)\nOn the other hand, what we will talk more about in Chapter 9 is combining these phylogenetic trees with spatial information about these cells. See Figure 7.26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.26: From Erickson et al. (2022). Panel a is the copy number events for each cell (here, this is actually based on spatial transcriptomics), and panel b is the estimated phylogenetic tree. From the tree, they can look at the spatial position of each clone and literally see on the 2D tissue slice how cancer clones (potentially aggressively) expanded in this tissue slice. The phylogenetic information gave us clues on which cancer subclone originated from which.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAshouri, Arghavan, Chufan Zhang, and Federico Gaiti. 2023. “Decoding Cancer Evolution: Integrating Genetic and Non-Genetic Insights.” Genes 14 (10): 1856.\n\n\nChan, Michelle M, Zachary D Smith, Stefanie Grosswendt, Helene Kretzmer, Thomas M Norman, Britt Adamson, Marco Jost, et al. 2019. “Molecular Recording of Mammalian Embryogenesis.” Nature 570 (7759): 77–82.\n\n\nErickson, Andrew, Mengxiao He, Emelie Berglund, Maja Marklund, Reza Mirzazadeh, Niklas Schultz, Linda Kvastad, et al. 2022. “Spatially Resolved Clonal Copy Number Alterations in Benign and Malignant Tissue.” Nature 608 (7922): 360–67.\n\n\nFu, Aikun, Bingqing Yao, Tingting Dong, and Shang Cai. 2023. “Emerging Roles of Intratumor Microbiota in Cancer Metastasis.” Trends in Cell Biology 33 (7): 583–93.\n\n\nJones, Matthew G, Alex Khodaverdian, Jeffrey J Quinn, Michelle M Chan, Jeffrey A Hussmann, Robert Wang, Chenling Xu, Jonathan S Weissman, and Nir Yosef. 2020. “Inference of Single-Cell Phylogenies from Lineage Tracing Data Using Cassiopeia.” Genome Biology 21 (1): 1–27.\n\n\nJones, Matthew G, Dian Yang, and Jonathan S Weissman. 2023. “New Tools for Lineage Tracing in Cancer in Vivo.”\n\n\nKaufmann, Tom L, Marina Petkovic, Thomas BK Watkins, Emma C Colliver, Sofya Laskina, Nisha Thapa, Darlan C Minussi, et al. 2022. “MEDICC2: Whole-Genome Doubling Aware Copy-Number Phylogenies for Cancer Evolution.” Genome Biology 23 (1): 241.\n\n\nKosicki, Michael, Felicity Allen, Frances Steward, Kärt Tomberg, Yangyang Pan, and Allan Bradley. 2022. “Cas9-Induced Large Deletions and Small Indels Are Controlled in a Convergent Fashion.” Nature Communications 13 (1): 3422.\n\n\nLi, Zizhang, Wenjing Yang, Peng Wu, Yuyan Shan, Xiaoyu Zhang, Feng Chen, Junnan Yang, and Jian-Rong Yang. 2024. “Reconstructing Cell Lineage Trees with Genomic Barcoding: Approaches and Applications.” Journal of Genetics and Genomics 51 (1): 35–47.\n\n\nLu, Bingxin. 2025. “Cancer Phylogenetic Inference Using Copy Number Alterations Detected from DNA Sequencing Data.” Cancer Pathogenesis and Therapy 3 (01): 16–29.\n\n\nMarine, Jean-Christophe, Sarah-Jane Dawson, and Mark A Dawson. 2020. “Non-Genetic Mechanisms of Therapeutic Resistance in Cancer.” Nature Reviews Cancer 20 (12): 743–56.\n\n\nMcVey, Mitch, and Sang Eun Lee. 2008. “MMEJ Repair of Double-Strand Breaks (Director’s Cut): Deleted Sequences and Alternative Endings.” Trends in Genetics 24 (11): 529–38.\n\n\nSollier, Etienne, Jack Kuipers, Koichi Takahashi, Niko Beerenwinkel, and Katharina Jahn. 2023. “COMPASS: Joint Copy Number and Mutation Phylogeny Reconstruction from Amplicon Single-Cell Sequencing Data.” Nature Communications 14 (1): 4921.\n\n\nStephenson, Emily, Gary Reynolds, Rachel A Botting, Fernando J Calero-Nieto, Michael D Morgan, Zewen Kelvin Tuong, Karsten Bach, et al. 2021. “Single-Cell Multi-Omics Analysis of the Immune Response in COVID-19.” Nature Medicine 27 (5): 904–16.\n\n\nVanHorn, Sadie, and Samantha A Morris. 2021. “Next-Generation Lineage Tracing and Fate Mapping to Interrogate Development.” Developmental Cell 56 (1): 7–21.\n\n\nWeiner, Samson, and Mukul S Bansal. 2025. “DICE: Fast and Accurate Distance-Based Reconstruction of Single-Cell Copy Number Phylogenies.” Life Science Alliance 8 (3).\n\n\nWeinreb, Caleb, Alejo Rodriguez-Fraticelli, Fernando D Camargo, and Allon M Klein. 2020. “Lineage Tracing on Transcriptional Landscapes Links State to Fate During Differentiation.” Science 367 (6479).",
