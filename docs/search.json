At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more.

It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies.

    "section": "2.3 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?",
    "text": "2.3 What do we hope to learn from single-cell data?\n\n2.3.1 Basic biology\nSingle-cell data offer a transformative lens to study the fundamental processes of life at unparalleled resolution. Unlike bulk data, which averages signals across populations of cells, single-cell technologies allow researchers to examine the diversity and complexity of individual cells within a tissue or organism. This level of detail provides insights into key biological phenomena, such as cellular differentiation during development, the plasticity of cell states in response to environmental cues, and the organization of complex tissues. For instance, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has uncovered new cell types in the brain and immune system, challenging traditional classifications and offering a more nuanced understanding of cellular identities and functions. These insights are essential for constructing more accurate models of how life operates at a cellular level.\nMany of the examples shown in Figs. Figure 2.1–Figure 2.2 are basic biology questions. Two additional examples are shown in ?fig-resistance .\n\n \nLeft: how cancer cells survive successive therapies (schaff2024clonal?).\nRight: what deteriorates in a cell as it ages (da2021principles?).\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Benchside-to-bedside applications\nSingle-cell data have enormous potential to revolutionize clinical practice by bridging molecular biology and medicine.\nAfter learning basic biology, the next stage is to use our newfound understanding to advance treatments. (We typically call this translation research, to denote translating our basic biology knowledge to therapeutic improvements.) This is also called benchside (for the wet-bench, i.e. laboratory setting) to bedside (for the hospital setting).\nBy mapping cellular heterogeneity in diseased and healthy tissues, researchers can identify specific cell populations driving disease progression and therapeutic resistance. For example, in cancer, single-cell analyses have uncovered rare tumor subclones that evade treatment, providing critical targets for drug development. Similarly, in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, single-cell profiling of synovial tissues has identified inflammatory cell states that correlate with disease severity and treatment response. Beyond diagnostics, this technology enables precision medicine by tailoring treatments to the molecular profiles of individual patients. As single-cell approaches continue to evolve, they are poised to refine drug-discovery pipelines, improve vaccine design, and ultimately transform how diseases are diagnosed and treated.\nThere are a few ways this typically happens. Figure 2.8 shows one example, where single-cell research helps identify the specific cell types and specific edits needed to improve cellular function.\nFigure 2.9 shows another example, where understanding the cellular functions, we can improve how conventional methods can be used to measure more accurate biomarkers.\nCancer research has been (by far) the biggest beneficiary of single-cell research, and Figure 2.10 illustrates how single-cell improves cancer therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",

    "text": "2.4 When did single-cell data become popular, and how has the technology advanced?\n\n2.4.1 The rise of single-cell data\nSingle-cell data began gaining prominence in the early 2010 s, fuelled by advances in microfluidics and next-generation sequencing. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), pioneered around 2009 – 2011, was among the first methods to achieve widespread adoption. It enabled measurement of gene expression in individual cells, uncovering heterogeneity that bulk analyses masked. Early applications revealed new cell types and states, reshaped our understanding of development, and identified rare populations in cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Popularity grew as throughput increased, costs fell, and workflows became standardised.\n?fig-single-cell1 contrasts bulk and single-cell sequencing.\n?fig-single-cell2 shows how single-cell data tease apart different sources of heterogeneity.\n\n \nIllustrations of how single-cell sequencing improves resolution for studying cancer resistance. Adapted from (shalek2017single?). {#fig-single-cell1}\n\n\n\nSingle-cell insights disentangle underlying biological mechanisms. Adapted from (lei2021applications?). {#fig-single-cell2}\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Expansion into other omics and spatial technologies\nBuilding on single-cell transcriptomics, the field rapidly expanded into other omics. Single-cell proteomics allows detailed analysis of protein expression and signalling pathways. Single-cell ATAC-seq profiles chromatin accessibility; Hi-C and related methods reveal 3-D genome architecture. Spatial transcriptomics connects gene expression with tissue context. CRISPR-based single-cell screens enable high-throughput perturbations, and lineage-tracing barcodes add a temporal dimension, charting cell ancestry in development and disease. Together, these advances transformed single-cell biology into a multi-dimensional, integrative discipline.\nMany of these technologies appear in Figure 2.11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11\n\n\n\nIllustration (circa 2020) of technologies that pair various omics at single-cell resolution.

    "text": "2.5 What is the role of a biostatistician in a wet-lab / clinical world?\nCell biology is vast—especially for students trained primarily in statistics or biostatistics. Many disciplines intersect with cell biology:\n\nStatistics / Biostatistics – statistical models for complex biological processes; translation between maths and biology\n\nComputational biology – scalable computation, leveraging public data\n\nBioinformatics / Genetics – tools that draw on large‐consortium resources\n\nEpidemiology – population-level data and policy recommendations\n\nBioengineering – new laboratory technologies for cheaper/faster measurement or imaging\n\nBiology – mechanistic studies in model organisms\n\nBiochemistry / Molecular biology – structure, function, interactions of specific molecules\n\nWet-bench medicine – disease mechanisms via tissues, models, cell lines\n\nClinical-facing medicine – patient treatment and real-world sample collection\n\nPharmacology – integrating evidence to design new drugs and therapies\n\nGiven so many players, what does a biostatistician contribute?\n\n2.5.1 How a biostatistician perceives the world\n\nGive me a concrete (ideally cleaned) dataset—the larger the better—and I will analyse it from many angles.\nCausality is a mathematically stricter notion than correlation, usually via\n\ncounterfactual reasoning, or\n\na directed-acyclic-graph picture of how variables relate.\n\n\n\nRemark (Personal opinion: statistical causality for cell biology is extremely difficult). Obstacles: (i) tracking the same cell over time is impossible because sequencing lyses it; (ii) longitudinal human tissue samples are rare. Strong modelling assumptions can help but must withstand biological scrutiny. The bottleneck is often data, not maths—ambitious statisticians who learn enough biology still have a fighting chance.\n\n\nRemark (Single-cell methods are largely an “associative” world). Most single-cell analyses discover mechanisms that are statistically correlational; the causal proof comes from experiments and biology.\n\n\nThe research inquiry starts and ends with a method.\n(How to integrate modalities? learn a gene-regulatory network? perform valid post-clustering tests?) Start with a statistical model and a parameter of interest \\(\\theta^\\*\\), then typically:\n\nDevelop a novel estimator of \\(\\theta^\\*\\), explaining why current methods fail (e.g. lack robustness, accuracy, power, or are heuristic).\n\n\n\nStatistical Logic: A clear, simple mathematical intuition should show the gap and how the new method fills it.\n\n\nProve theorems showing the estimate \\(\\hat\\theta\\) converges to \\(\\theta^\\*\\) under stated assumptions.\n\n\nConsistency & Convergence: More data should provably yield more accurate results (often the highlight of a statistics paper).\n\n\nSimulations demonstrating that when the true \\(\\theta^\\*\\) is known, \\(\\hat\\theta\\) beats competing estimators across many settings.\n\n\nBenchmarking: Empirically recover the correct answer more often than existing methods.\n\n\nReal-data demonstration showing results align with known biology or provide biologically sensible new insights.\n\n\nPracticality: The method must work in real scenarios mirroring its target audience.\n\nMindset: deliver a reliable tool that others can trust as-is. Human validations are often impractical; guard-rails and diagnostics are vital.\nWhy biostatisticians need wet-lab biologists / clinicians:\nWe rarely generate data ourselves, so collaborators supply (i) exciting data with novel questions, (ii) biological context for sensible assumptions, and (iii) experimental validation of statistical findings.\n\n\n2.5.2 How a wet-lab biologist / clinician perceives the world\n\nExperiments, experiments, experiments. Carefully controlled—even if small—to make downstream analysis straightforward.\nCausality comes from a chain of experiments. Suppose we study a gene’s role in disease:\n\nTemporal evidence – gene change precedes the outcome in clonal mice.\n::: {.block} (Temporal)\nA causal mechanism should occur before the phenotype. :::\nBiological logic – mechanistic explanation (binding factors, protein function, evolutionary rationale, etc.).\n::: {.block} (Biological Logic)\nThere must be a coherent pathway from gene → protein → phenotype. :::\nUniversality – association persists across cell lines or organisms.\n::: {.block} (Universality)\nA causal mechanism should be discoverable in other systems (extent depends on how general the logic is). Often the highlight of a biology paper. :::\nValidation – knocking out the gene alters the outcome, whereas similar genes do not.\n::: {.block} (Validation)\nPerturbing the specific gene (not its close counterparts) changes the outcome. :::\n\nInquiry starts and ends with a biological hypothesis. Large intellectual effort goes into proposing explanations and designing experiments to rule them in or out.\n\nMindset: assemble overwhelming evidence for a mechanism, combining careful experiments and biological logic.\nWhy wet-lab scientists need biostatisticians:\nData are now complex and plentiful; exhaustive experiments for every hypothesis are infeasible. Statistical methods can (i) account for data & biological complexity and (ii) prioritise hypotheses worth experimental investment.\n\nSo how does a biostatistician develop computational / statistical methods for cell biology?\n\n\nBiological context – What system and “north-star” question? Which premises are accepted, which are tested, and why does this mechanism matter?\n\nTechnology, experiment, data – How are data collected and why this {technology, experiment, data} trio? What technical artefacts arise?\n\nBoundaries of current tools – Simple analyses first: what breaks? Is there preliminary evidence a new method would do better?\n\nStatistical model – What insight can better interrogate the biology? (Here the statistics training begins.)\n\nDevelop a method & show robustness – Numerically (noise tolerance) and biologically (applicable across contexts). Often biology lacks a ground truth, so validity arguments lean on biological logic.\n\nUncover new / refined biology – Does the method advance understanding? How confident are we that findings generalise beyond the original {technology, experiment, data} trio? (Usually the paper’s highlight.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVon Bernhardi, Rommy, Laura Eugenı́n-von Bernhardi, and Jaime Eugenı́n. 2015. “Microglial Cell Dysregulation in Brain Aging and Neurodegeneration.” Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience 7: 124.\n\n\nWen, Lu, Guoqiang Li, Tao Huang, Wei Geng, Hao Pei, Jialiang Yang, Miao Zhu, et al. 2022. “Single-Cell Technologies: From Research to Application.” The Innovation 3 (6).\n\n\nZhou, Yi, Hongjun Song, and Guo-li Ming. 2024. “Genetics of Human Brain Development.” Nature Reviews Genetics 25 (1): 26–45.",
