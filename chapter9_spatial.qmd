Single-cell spatial transcriptomics is an emerging technology that enables the measurement of gene expression while preserving the spatial organization of cells within a tissue. See Figure 201 for a useful schematic I like. Unlike traditional single-cell RNA sequencing, which dissociates cells and loses spatial context, spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to analyze gene expression in relation to cellular neighborhoods, tissue architecture, and microenvironments, see Figure 202.
