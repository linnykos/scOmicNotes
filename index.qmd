This is a Quarto book made from the content of BIOST 545 (Biostatistical Methods for Big Omics Data), taught by Dr. Kevin Lin at the University of Washington, Winter 2025. The lecture notes in BIOST 545 are meant to ease you into reading these notes, and the notes are meant to be a gateway to many references where the course's goal is for you 1) to determine for yourself what areas you find interesting and are relevant to your research goals, and 2) use the references as a portal to find many ideas to bolster your own research. This Quarto book is assembled with the help of many student volunteers at the University of Washington: Xinmei Huang.
