## Why study cell biology in public health?

### What are “omics”?

The term **“omics”** refers to a broad field of biology aimed at the comprehensive characterisation and quantification of biological molecules that translate into the structure, function, and dynamics of an organism. At its core, “omics” encapsulates the idea of studying biological systems at a global scale rather than focusing on individual components. This includes genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), epigenomics, metabolomics (metabolites), and more. Each of these fields leverages high-throughput technologies to generate massive datasets that capture complex interactions within cells, tissues, or organisms.

The rise of “omics” has revolutionised biology by enabling researchers to ask holistic questions such as how different genes, proteins, or metabolites interact in health and disease. It emphasises understanding systems as interconnected networks rather than isolated elements. This systems-level approach is particularly powerful in identifying biomarkers, understanding disease mechanisms, and tailoring precision-medicine strategies. In public health, “omics” provides tools to bridge molecular discoveries with population-level outcomes, offering new opportunities to tackle complex health challenges.

#### Some examples of a “cell-biology” question

-   How the brain develops (i.e. the longitudinal sequence of events between birth and maturation), shown in @fig-brain-development.\
-   How microglia in the brain gain or lose certain functions during ageing, shown in @fig-microglia.\
-   Why certain cells (i.e. cancer cells) divide uncontrollably, see @fig-cancer.

### How “omics” comes into the picture

To answer cell-biology questions we leverage different omics to learn clues about\
1. the cellular functions of a biological system, and\
2. how those functions change during disease, ageing, etc.

All these omics are related:

-   The **central dogma** of biology (DNA → RNA → protein) is illustrated in @fig-central-dogma1 and @fig-central-dogma2, linking the three most fundamental omics.\
-   The **epigenome**, shown in @fig-epigenetic, comprises chemical modifications to DNA and histone proteins that regulate gene expression yet are *not* part of the DNA itself. The figure highlights three commonly studied features: DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, and histone modifications.

These layers are summarised in @fig-omics1.

**Remark (Personal opinion: Biology is constantly revising the details).**\
Statistical knowledge is rarely **revised**—mostly **refined**. We know properties that generalize to much broader settings (i.e., less statistical assumptions) and much more refined statistical rates for the settings studied two decades ago. (1) There's little revisions, since once someone proves a statistical theorem, it is very unlikely for it to get disproven in the future. (2) Statistics generally focuses on what happens in an \`\`average/typical'' scenario.

Biology, in comparison, has many revisions and refinements. There's a couple reasons for this: (1) Biology research is driven by technology. Hence, as we can image/sequence/profile new aspects of a cell, design new model organisms, or collect more data, we might revise a lot of understanding of how cells work. (2) While there are *broad* biological mechanisms that generally hold true, many diseases occur when the general biological principle no longer holds true. For this reasons, a lot of cell biology research is about these *exceptions*, which cause us to question how universally true a biological mechanism is. (As a simple example -- we're taught humans have 46 chromosomes. However, many conditions such as Down Syndrome, originate from having an abnormal number of chromosomes.)

**Remark (All the omics we will study in this course are matrices).**\
One of major missions of this course is to answer the following question: Every omic is represented as a matrix (generally, where the rows are cells, and columns are certain features, depending on the omic). In that case, how come some statistical methods designed for one omic isn't applicable for another omic?

While there are certain statistical answers to this question, most of the answers are based on biology. Certain methods rely on a specific biological premise, and that premise becomes hard to justify as you switch from one omic to another.

This is not too dissimilar from a causal analysis. In a causal analysis, the reason certain features get labeled as a confounder, treatment, outcome, instrumental variable, mediator, etc. relies on the *context*.
